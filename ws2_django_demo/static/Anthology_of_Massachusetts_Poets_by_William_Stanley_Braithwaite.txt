  HOME-BOUND

  THE moon is a wavering rim where one fish slips,
  The water makes a quietness of sound;
  Night is an anchoring of many ships
  Home-bound.

  There are strange tunnelers in the dark, and whirs
  Of wings that die, and hairy spiders spin
  The silence into nets, and tenanters
  Move softly in.

  I step on shadows riding through the grass,
  And feel the night lean cool against my face;
  And challenged by the sentinel of space,
  I pass.

  JOSEPH AUSLANDE



  AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL

  O BEAUTIFUL for spacious skies,
  For amber waves of grain,
  For purple mountain majesties
  Above the fruited plain!
  America!  America!
  God shed His grace on thee
  And crown thy good with brotherhood
  From sea to shining sea!

  O beautiful for pilgrim feet,
  Those stern, impassioned stress
  A thoroughfare for freedom beat
  Across the wilderness!
  America!  America!
  God mend thine every flaw,
  Confirm thy soul in self-control,
  Thy liberty in law!

  O beautiful for heroes proved
  In liberating strife
  Who more than self their country loved,
  And mercy more than life!
  America!  America!
  May God thy gold refine,
  Till all success be nobleness,
  And every gain divine.

  O beautiful for patriot dream
  That sees beyond the years
  Thine alabaster cities gleam

  Undimmed by human tears!
  America! America!
  God shed His grace on thee
  And crown thy good with brotherhood
  From sea to shining sea!

  KATHERINE LEE BATES



  YELLOW CLOVER

  MUST I, who walk alone,
  come on it still,
  This Puck of plants
  The wise would do away with,
  The sunshine slants
  To play with,
  Our wee, gold-dusty flower, the yellow clover,
  Which once in Parting for a time
  That then seemed long,
  Ere time for you was over,
  We sealed our own?
  Do you remember yet,
  O Soul beyond the stars,
  Beyond the uttermost dim bars
  Of space,
  Dear Soul, who found earth sweet,
  Remember by love's grace,
  In dreamy hushes of the heavenly song,
  How suddenly we halted in our climb,
  Lingering, reluctant, up that farthest hill,
  Stooped for the blossoms closest to our feet,
  And gave them as a token
  Each to Each,
  In lieu of speech,
  In lieu of words too grievous to be spoken,
  Those little, gypsy, wondering blossoms wet
  With a strange dew of tears?

  So it began,
  This vagabond, unvalued yellow clover,
  To be our tenderest language. All the years
  It lent a new zest to the summer hours,
  As each of us went scheming to surprise
  The other with our homely, laureate flowers.
  Sonnets and odes
  Fringing our daily roads.
  Can amaranth and asphodel
  Bring merrier laughter to your eyes?
  Oh, if the Blest, in their serene abodes,
  Keep any wistful consciousness of earth,
  Not grandeurs, but the childish ways of love,
  Simplicities of mirth,
  Must follow them above
  With touches of vague homesickness that pass
  Like shadows of swift birds across the grass.
  Beneath some foreign arch of sky,
  How many a time the rover
  You or I,
  For life oft sundered look from look,
  And voice from voice, the transient dearth
  Schooling my soul to brook
  This distance that no messages may span,
  Would chance
  Upon our wilding by a lonely well,
  Or drowsy watermill,
  Or swaying to the chime of convent bell,
  Or where the nightingales of old romance
  With tragical contraltos fill
  Dim solitudes of infinite desire;
  And once I joyed to meet
  Our peasant gadabout
  A trespasser on trim, seigniorial seat,
  Twinkling a saucy eye
  As potentates paced by.

  Our golden cord! our soft, pursuing flame
  From friendship's altar fire!
  How proudly we would pluck and tame

  The dimpling clusters, mutinously gay!
  How swiftly they were sent
  Far, far away
  On journeys wide,
  By sea and continent,
  Green miles and blue leagues over,
  From each of us to each,
  That so our hearts might reach,
  And touch within the yellow clover,

  Love's letter to be glad about
  Like sunshine when it came!

  My sorrow asks no healing; it is love;
  Let love then make me brave
  To bear the keen hurts of
  This careless summertide,
  Ay, of our own poor flower,
  Changed with our fatal hour,
  For all its sunshine vanished when you died;
  Only white clover blossoms on your grave.

  KATHERINE LEE BATES


  THE RETURNING

  We long for her, we yearn for her--
  Yes, ardently we yearn
  For her return.
  Recalling those beloved days
  (Days intimate with ways
  Of friends so near to us
  And life so dear to us),
  We yearn unspeakably for her return.

  And come she must... Yet while we trust
  We soon may see the passing of this agony
  Which makes intrusive years still seem
  A fearsome dream,
  We know that when she comes
  She really comes not back again.

  She'll come in other guise
  And under fairer skies--
  And yet to bitter pain!
  That day she went away
  Our homes with laughing youth were filled.
  Where then was happiness
  Is now distress,
  The laughter stilled;
  For when she left
  Youth followed her--
  We stay bereft.

  So all our golden joy
  For what she brings
  Must carry gray alloy:
  The sorrow that she can not lay,
  The mysery that she can not stay--
  While all the gladsome songs she sings
  Must bear for undertones
  Old sighs and echoed moans.

  As they who go away
  In flush of youth
  May come quite worn and gray
  And bringing naught but ruth--
  So, when the strife shall cease,
  And when she comes at last,
  When all the armies vast
  Shall at her feet
  Kneel down to greet
  Thrice welcome Peace,
  This world will be so changed
  (So many dear ones dead,
  So many friends estranged,
  So many blessings fled,
  So many wonted ways forever barred,
  So many coming days forever marred)
  That then
  She truly comes not back again--
  She, the Peace we knew.

  Yet how we long for her!
  How ardently we yearn
  For her return!

  SYLVESTER BAXTER


  TWO MOODS FROM THE HILL

  I.

  YOUTH

  I LOVE to watch the world from here, for all
  The numberless living portraits that are drawn
  Upon the mind.  Far over is the sea,
  Fronting the sand, a few great yellow dunes,
  A salt marsh stumbling after, rank and green,
  With brackish gullies wandering in between,
  All this from the hill.
  And more: a clump of dwarfed and twisted cedars,
  Sentinels over the marsh, and bright with the sun
  A field of daises wandering in the wind
  As though a hidden serpent glided through,
  A broken wall, a new-plowed field, and then
  The dusty road and the abodes of men
  Surrounding the hill.
  How small the enclosure is wherein there lives
  Each phase and passion of life, the distant sail
  Dips in the limpid bosom of the sea,
  From that far place to where in state the turf
  Raises a throne for me upon the hill,
  Each little love and lust of a living thing
  Can thus be compassed in a rainbow ring
  And seen from the hill.

  II.

  AGE

  Why did I build my cottage on a hill Facing the sea?

  Why did I plan each terraced lawn to slope
  Down to the deep blue billowy breast of hope,
  Surging and sweeping,
  laughing and leaping,
  Tumbling its garments of foam upon the shore,
  Rustling the sands that know my step no more,
  I should have found a valley, deep and still,
  To shelter me.

  There flows the river, and it seems asleep
  So far away,
  Yet I remember whip of wave and roar
  Of wind that rose and smote against the oar,
  Smote and retreated,
  Proud but defeated,
  While I rejoiced and rowed into the brine,
  Drawing on wet and heavy-straining line
  The great cod quivering from the deep
  As counterplay.

  What is the solace of these hills and vales
  That rise and fall?
  What is there glorious in the greenwood glen,
  Or twittering thrush or wing of darting wren?
  Give me the gusty,
  Raucous and rusty
  Call of the sea gull in the echoing sky,
  The wild shriek of the winds that cannot die,
  Give me the life that follows the bending sails,
  Or none at all!

  ERNEST BENSHIMOL


  A BANQUET
  ONE MEMORY FROM SOCRATES

  AFTER the song the love, and after the love the play,
  Flute girl and pretty boy blowing
  Bubbles of sparkling
  Wine into darkling
  Beards of a former austerity, stern even now, but
  Fast growing
  Foolish, with less of a stately
  Reserve that held them sedately.
  Oh Zeus, what a sight! With the wine dripping off it,
  The grin of an ass on a bald-pated prophet.

  After the feast the night, and after the night the day,
  Fool and philosopher stirring
  With the day dawning,
  Stretching and yawning,
  While in each wine-throbbing, desolated brain is the
  Wheeling and whirring
  Of thousands of bats, that the slaking
  Of throats will not hinder from aching,
  No wine for the brow that is beating to bursting,
  But water at morning is quench for the thirsting!

  ERNEST BENSHIMOL


  SONG

  OUT of one heart the birds and I together,
  Earth hushed in twilight,
  Low through the live-oaks hung heavy with silver,
  Gemmed with the sky-light,
  Under the great wet star
  Shaking with light, we jar
  Lute-voiced the silence with intervaled music.

  While under the margined world the slow sun lingers,
  Flaming earth's portal,
  Over the lilac dusk spreads his great fingers--
  Earth is immortal!
  While the frail beauty dies.
  Dream in the dreamer's eyes,
  All the good gladness turns praise for the singers.

  Hark, 'tis the breath of life!  Hush! and I need it;
  Northern, gigantic,--
  Questing the silences, herding the sudden foam
  Down the Atlantic;
  Leaves from the autumn's store
  Shrill at my desert door,
  They and I out of one heart that is grieving.

  GEORGE CABOT LODGE


  THE WORLDS

  I SAW an idler on a summer day
  Piping with Iris by a dancing brook;
  And all his world was rife with Pleasures gay,
  And languid Follies smiled from every nook.

  I saw an artist in a world of dreams,
  His rainbow rising from his radiant task,
  To throw its magic prism beams
  O'er Fancy's changeful masque and counter-masque.

  I saw Toil--stooping underneath a world
  Whereon his foster-brothers lighter tread,
  His skyward pinions ever closer furled
  Before the grim necessity of bread!

  I saw a sinner working hard to be
  Worthy his death-wage from the mint of time;
  I saw a sailor, unto whom the sea
  Was hearth and hope and love and wedding-chime.

  I saw a mother living in her child--
  I saw a saint among his fellow men--
  Brave soldiery before my eyes defiled
  And solemn-hearted scholars--Sudden then

  I cried: "The stars are no less neighborly
  In their ethereal remoteness swung,
  Than these near human orbits wherein we
  Live out our lives and speak our chosen tongue!


  "Love seek through all--less there be one
  Least soul unlit within the night--
  And over all, the selfsame sun
  Give each creation light!"

  MARTHA GILBERT DICKINSON BIANCHI


  THE RIOT

  YOU may think my life is quiet.
  I find it full of change,
  An ever-varied diet,
  As piquant as 'tis strange.

  Wild thoughts are always flying,
  Like sparks across my brain,
  Now flashing out, now dying,
  To kindle soon again.

  Fine fancies set me thrilling,
  And subtle monsters creep
  Before my sight unwilling:
  They even haunt my sleep.

  One broad, perpetual riot
  Enfolds me night and day.
  You think my life is quiet?
  You don't know what you say.

  GAMALIEL BRADFORD



  HUNGER

  I'VE been a hopeless sinner, but I understand a saint,
  Their bend of weary knees and their contortions long and faint,
  And the endless pricks of conscience, like a hundred thousand pins,
  A real perpetual penance for imaginary sins.

  I love to wander widely, but I understand a cell,
  Where you tell and tell your beads because you've nothing else to tell,
  Where the crimson joy of flesh, with all its wild fantastic tricks,
  Is forgotten in the blinding glory of the crucifix.

  I cannot speak for others, but my inmost soul is torn
  With a battle of desires making all my life forlorn.
  There are moments when I would untread the paths that I have trod.
  I'm a haunter of the devil, but I hunger after God.

  GAMALIEL BRADFORD


  EXIT GOD

  Of old our father's God was real,
  Something they almost saw,
  Which kept them to a stern ideal
  And scourged them into awe.

  They walked the narrow path of right
  Most vigilantly well,
  Because they feared eternal night
  And boiling depths of Hell.

  Now Hell has wholly boiled away
  And God become a shade.
  There is no place for him to stay
  In all the world He made.

  The followers of William James
  Still let the Lord exist,
  And call Him by imposing names,
  A venerable list.
  But nerve and muscle only count,
  Gray matter of the brain,
  And an astonishing amount
  Of inconvenient pain.

  I sometimes wish that God were back
  In this dark world and wide;
  For though sonic virtues He might lack,
  He had his pleasant side.

  GAMALIEL BRADFORD



  ROUSSEAU

  THAT odd, fantastic ass, Rousseau,
  Declared himself unique.
  How men persist in doing so,
  Puzzles me more than Greek.

  The sins that tarnish whore and thief
  Beset me every day.
  My most ethereal belief
  Inhabits common clay.

  GAMALIEL BRADFORD


  JOHN MASEFIELD

  I

  MASEFIELD (HIMSELF)

  GOD said, and frowned, as He looked on Shropshire clay:
  "Alone, 'twont do; composite, would I make
  This man-child rare; 'twere well, methinks, to take
  A handful from the Stratford tomb, and weigh
  A few of Shelley's ashes; Bunyan may
  Contribute, too, and, for my sweet Son's sake,
  I'll visit Avalon; then, let me slake
  The whole with Wyclif-water from the Bay.

  A sailor, he!  Too godly, though, I fear;
  Offset it with tobacco!  Next, I'll find
  Hedge-roses, star-dust, and a vagrant's mind;
  His mother's heart now let me breathe upon;
  When west winds blow, I'll whisper in her ear:
  "Apocalypse awaits him; call him John!"

  II

  HIS PORTRAIT

  A Man of Sorrows! with such haunted eyes,
  I trow, the Master looked across the lake,--
  Looked from the Judas-heart, so soon to make
  Of Him the world's historic sacrifice;
  Moreover, as I gaze, do more arise;
  Great souls, great pallid ghosts of pain, who wake
  And wander yet; all, weary men who brake
  Their hearts; all hemlock-drunk, with growing wise:
  Hudson adrift; Defoe; the Wandering Jew;
  Tannhauser; Faust; Andrea; phantoms, all,
  In Masefield's eyes you lodge; and to the wall
  I turn you,--hand a-tremble,--lest you make
  Of mine own stricken eyes a mirror, too.
  Wherein the sad world's sadder for your sake.


  III

  HIS "DAUBER"

  O Masefield's "Dauber!" You, who being dead,
  Yet speak: heroic, dauntless, flaming soul,
  Too suddenly snuffed out!  Here take fresh toll
  Of cognizance, and, in your ocean bed,
  Serenely rest, assured that who has read
  What you would fain have pictured of the Pole
  Would gladly match your part against the whole
  Of many a modern artist, Paris-bred.

  And more than this: if you, indeed, are his,
  Then, by a dual truth, he, too, is yours;
  For, marked and credited by what endures,
  Were it the only thing, which bears his name,
  (O deathless Soul, I speak you true in this!)
  "The Dauber" has brought Masefield to his fame.

  IV

  HIS "GALLIPOLI"

  "Small wonder," speaks my pensive self, "that he
  Whose passion 'tis to sing of men who fail,--
  (Belabored, broken by The Unseen Flail)
  Small wonder that be makes Gallipoli

  His fervent text, for could there be
  A costlier failure in Earth's shuddering tale?
  Think of heroic Sulva's bloody swale;
  Of Anzac's tortured thirst and agony!"
  But as I read, protesting voices cry: "Not we,
  Not we, who fell among the daffodils,
  Who conquered Death among those blistered hills,
  And found our glory after mortal pain;
  Not we, who failed and lost Gallipoli;
  The sad, strange failure theirs who mourn in vain!"

  V

  HIS MEAD

  So, Masefield, have your royal words once more
  Called forth the praise of men, where praise is due;
  Your great elegiac, tragically true,
  Must leave all Britain prouder than before;
  And, in spite of all that breaking hearts deplore,
  And all that anguished consciences must rue,
  One arrowed gladness surely pierces through
  From London's centre to Canadian shore:

  When England, sobbing, mourns Gallipoli,
  When warm tears flow for Rupert Brooke
  And all the splendid Youth her error took
  As hostage from the fields of daffodils,
  Let this a present, living solace be:
  You are not sleeping in those cruel hills!

  AMY BRIDGEMAN



  1620-1920

  BEFORE him rolls the dark, relentless ocean;
  Behind him stretch the cold and barren sands;
  Wrapt in the mantle of his deep devotion
  The Pilgrim kneels, and clasps his lifted hands;

  "God of our fathers, who hast safely brought us
  Through seas and sorrows, famine, fire, and sword;
  Who, in Thy mercies manifold hast taught us
  To trust in Thee, our leader and our Lord;

  "God, who hast send Thy truth to shine before us,
  A fiery pillar, beaconing on the sea;
  God, who hast spread thy wings of mercy o'er us;
  God, who hast set our children's children free,

  "Freedom Thy new-born nation here shall cherish;
  Grant us Thy covenant, changing, sure:
  Earth shall decay; the firmament shall perish;
  Freedom and Truth, immortal shall endure."

  Face to the Indian arrows.
  Face to the Prussian guns,
  From then till now the Pilgrim's vow
  Has held the Pilgrim's sons.

  He braved the red man's ambush,
  He loosed the black man's chain;
  His spirit broke King George's yoke
  And the battleships of Spain.

  He crossed the seething ocean;
  He dared the death-strewn track;
  He charged in the hell of Saint Mihiel
  And hurled the tyrant back.

  For the voice of the lonely Pilgrim
  Who knelt upon the strand
  A people hears three hundred years
  In the conscience of the land.

  Daughter of Truth and mother of Courage,
  Conscience, all hail!
  Heart of New England, strength of the Pilgrims,
  Thou shalt prevail.
  Look how the empires rise and fall!
  Athens robed in her learning and beauty,
  Rome in her royal lust for power--
  Each has flourished for her little hour,
  Risen and fallen and ceased to be.
  What of her by the Western Sea,
  Born and bred as the child of Duty,
  Sternest of them all?
  She it is and she alone
  Who built on faith as her corner stone;
  Of all the nations none but she
  Knew that the truth shall make us free.
  Daughter of Courage, mother of heros,
  Freedom divine.
  Light of New England, Star of the Pilgrim,
  Still shalt thou shine.
  Yet even as we in our pride rejoice,
  Hark to the prophet's warning voice:
  "The Pilgrim's thrift is vanished
  And the Pilgrim's faith is dead,
  And the Pilgrim's God is banished,
  And Mammon reigns in his stead;
  And work is damned as an evil,
  And men and women cry,
  In their restless haste, 'Let us spend and waste,
  And live; for to-morrow we die.'

  "And law is trampled under;
  And the nations stand aghast,
  As they hear the distant thunder
  Of the storm that marches fast;
  And we,--whose ocean borders
  Shut off the sound and the sight,
  We will wait for marching orders;
  The world has seen us fight;
  We have earned our days of revel;
  'On with the dance'! we cry.
  It is pain to think; we will eat and drink!
  And live; for to-morrow we die."

  "We have laughed in the eyes of danger;
  We have given our bravest and best;
  We have succored the starving stranger;
  Others shall heed the rest.'
  And the revel never ceases;
  And the nations hold their breath;
  And our laughter peals, and the mad world reels,
  To a carnival of death.

  "Slaves of sloth and the senses,
  Clippers of Freedom's wings,
  Come back to the Pilgrim's Army
  And fight for the King of Kings;
  Come back to the Pilgrim's conscience;
  Be born in the nation's birth;
  And strive again as simple men
  For the freedom of the earth.
  Freedom a free-born nation still shall cherish,
  Be this our covenant, unchanging, sure:
  Earth shall decay; the firmament shall perish;
  Freedom and Truth immortal shall endure."

  Land of our fathers, when the tempest rages,
  When the wide earth is racked with war and crime,
  Founded forever on the Rock of Ages,
  Beaten in vain by surging seas of time,

  Even as the shallop on the breakers riding,
  Even as the Pilgrim kneeling on the shore,
  Firm in thy faith and fortitude abiding,
  Hold thou thy children free forever more.

  And when we sail as Pilgrims' sons and daughters
  The spirit's Mayflower into seas unknown,
  Driving across the waste of wintry waters
  The voyage every soul shall make alone,

  The Pilgrim's faith, the Pilgrim's courage grant us;
  Still shines the truth that for the Pilgrim shone.
  We are his seed; nor life nor death shall daunt us.
  The port is Freedom!  Pilgrim heart, sail on!

  LE BARON RUSSELL BRIGGS



  THE CROSS-CURRENT

  THROUGH twelve stout generations
  New England blood I boast;
  The stubborn pastures bred them,
  The grim, uncordial coast,

  Sedate and proud old cities,--
  Loved well enough by me,
  Then how should I be yearning
  To scour the earth and sea.

  Each of my Yankee forbears
  Wed a New England mate:
  They dwelt and did and died here,
  Nor glimpsed a rosier fate.

  My clan endured their kindred;
  But foreigners they loathed,
  And wandering folk, and minstrels,
  And gypsies motley-clothed.

  Then why do patches please me,
  Fantastic, wild array?
  Why have I vagrant fancies
  For lads from far away.

  My folk were godly Churchmen,--
  Or paced in Elders' weeds;
  But all were grave and pious
  And hated heathen creeds.

  Then why are Thor and Wotan
  To dread forces still?
  Why does my heart go questing
  For Pan beyond the hill?

  My people clutched at freedom.--
  Though others' wills they chained,--
  But made the Law and kept it,--
  And Beauty, they restrained.

  Then why am I a rebel
  To laws of rule and square?
  Why would I dream and dally,
  Or, reckless, do and dare?

  O righteous, solemn Grandsires,
  O dames, correct and mild,
  Who bred me of your virtues!
  Whence comes this changing child?--

  The thirteenth generation,--
  Unlucky number this!--
  My grandma loved a Pirate,
  And all my faults are his!

  A gallant, ruffled rover,
  With beauty-loving eye,
  He swept Colonial waters
  Of coarser, bloodier fry.

  He waved his hat to danger,
  At Law he shook his fist.
  Ah, merrily he plundered,
  He sang and fought and kissed!

  Though none have found his treasure,
  And none his part would take,--
  I bless that thirteenth lady
  Who chose him for my sake!

  CANDLEMAS

  O HEARKEN, all ye little weeds
  That lie beneath the snow,
  (So low, dear hearts, in poverty so low!)
  The sun hath risen for royal deeds,
  A valiant wind the vanguard leads;
  Now quicken ye, lest unborn seeds
  Before ye rise and blow.

  O furry living things, adream
  On winter's drowsy breast,
  (How rest ye there, how softly, safely rest!)
  Arise and follow where a gleam
  Of wizard gold unbinds the stream,
  And all the woodland windings seem
  With sweet expectance blest.

  My birds, come back! the hollow sky
  Is weary for your note.
  (Sweet-throat, come back! O liquid, mellow throat!)
  Ere May's soft minions hereward fly,
  Shame on ye, Laggards, to deny
  The brooding breast, the sun-bright eye,
  The tawny, shining coat!

  ALICE BROWN



  SUNRISE ON MANSFIELD MOUNTAIN

  O SWIFT forerunners, rosy with the race!
  Spirits of dawn, divinely manifest
  Behind your blushing banners in the sky,
  Daring invaders of Night's tenting-ground,
  How do ye strain on forward-bending foot,
  Each to be first in heralding of joy!

  With silence sandalled, so they weave their way,
  And so they stand, with silence panoplied,
  Chanting, through mystic symbollings of flame,
  Their solemn invocation to the light.

  O changeless guardians! O ye wizard first!
  What strenuous philter feeds your potency.
  That thus ye rest, in sweet wood-hardiness,
  Ready to learn of all and utter naught?
  What breath may move ye, or what breeze invite
  To odorous hot lendings of the heart?
  What wind-but all the winds are yet afar,
  And e'en the little tricksy zephyr sprites,
  That fleet before them, like their elfin locks,
  Have lagged in sleep, nor stir nor waken yet
  To pluck the robe of patient majesty.

  Too still for dreaming, too divine for sleep,
  So range the firs, the constant, fearless ones.
  Warders of mountain secrets, there they wait,
  Each with his cloak about him, breathless, calm.
  And yet expectant, as who knows the dawn,

  And all night thrills with memory and desire,
  Searching in what has been for what shall be:

  The marvel of the ne'er familiar day,
  Sacred investiture of life renewed,
  The chrism of dew, the coronal of flame.
  Low in the valley lies the conquered rout
  Of man's poor, trivial turmoil, lost and drowned
  Under the mist, in gleaming rivers rolled,
  Where oozy marsh contends with frothing main.
  And rounding all, springs one full, ambient arch,
  One great good limpid world--so still, so still!
  For no sound echoes from its crystal curve
  Save four clear notes, the song of that lone bird
  Who, brave but trembling, tries his morning hymn,
  And has no heart to finish, for the awe
  And wonder of this pearling globe of dawn.

  Light, light eternal! veiling-place of stars!
  Light, the revealer of dread beauty's face!
  Weaving whereof the hills are lambent clad!
  Mighty libation to the Unknown God!
  Cup whereat pine-trees slake their giant thirst
  And little leaves drink sweet delirium!
  Being and breath and potion! living soul
  And all-informing heart of all that lives!
  How can we magnify thine awful name
  Save by its chanting: Light! and Light! and Light!
  An exhalation from far sky retreats,
  It grows in silence, as 'twere self-create,
  Suffusing all the dusky web of night.
  But one lone corner it invades not yet,
  Where low above a black and rimy crag
  Hangs the old moon, thin as a battered shield,
  The holy, useless shield of long-past wars,
  Dinted and frosty, on the crystal dark.
  But lo! the east,--let none forget the east,
  Pathway ordained of old where He should tread.
  Through some sweet magic common in the skies,
  The rosy banners are with saffron tinct;
  The saffron grows to gold, the gold is fire,
  And led by silence more majestical
  Than clash of conquering arms, He comes! He comes!
  He holds His spear benignant, sceptrewise,
  And strikes out flame from the adoring hills.

  BURNT ARE THE PETALS OF LIFE

  BURNT are the petals of life as a rose fallen and crumbled to dust.
  Blackened the heart of the past is, ashes that must
  Forever be sifted, more precious than sunbeams that
    open the budding to-morrow.
  Once was a passion completed,-too perfect, the
    Gods have not broken to borrow--
  Blackened the heart of the past is, ashes that must
  Forever be sifted. O, loving to-morrow
  The rose of the past is, Life-Eternity's dust.

  ELSIE PUMPELLY CABOT



  FOUR FOUNTAINS AFTER RESPIGHI

  FRESH mists of Roman dawn;
  For water search the cattle;
  Faintly on damp air sounds the shepherd's horn
  Above fountain Giulia's prattle.

  Triton, joyous and loud
  Of Naiads summons troops;
  A frenziedly leaping and mingling crowd,
  Dancing, pursuing groups.

  At high noon the trumpets peal,
  Neptune's chariot passes by;
  Trains of sirens, tritons, Trevi's jets heal
  Then trumpets' echoes sigh.

  Tolling bell and sunset,
  Twittering birds and calm;
  Medici's fountain, shimmering net,
  Into the night brings balm.

  JESSICA CARR



  IN THE TROLLEY CAR

  THE swart Italian in the trolley car,
  Hoarded his children in his arms and breast;
  The mother, all unheeding, sat afar,
  Her splendid eyes were vague, her lips compressed.

  One Raphael-boy slipped from his father's knee,
  Climbed to her side, and gently stroked her cheek,
  She turned away, and would not hear his plea,
  She turned away, and would not even speak.

  With trembling lips the child crept back again
  To the warm shelter of his father's breast;
  We looked indignant pity, for till then
  We thought that mother-love bore every test.

  We rose to go, the father-mother said,
  In deep, low tones, "Don't t'inka hard you bet
  The younges' was too-seeck, and he is dead,
  She will be alla right, when she forget."

  When she forgets!  "Great-Heart," hold closer yet
  Thy precious brood and let it feel no lack!
  Until her soul shall wake, but not forget,
  When the warm tides of love come surging back.

  RUTH BALDWIN CHENERY



  IN IRISH RAIN

  THE great world stretched its arms to me and held me to its breast,
  They say I've song-birds in my throat, and give me of their best;
  But sure, not all their gold can buy, can take me back again
  To little Mag o' Monagan's a-singing in the rain.

  The silver-slanting Irish rain, all warm and sweet that fills
  The little brackened lowland pools, and drifts across the hills;
  That turns the hill-grass cool and wet to dusty childish feet,
  And hangs above the valley-roofs, filmed blue with burning peat.

  And oh the kindly neighbor-folk that called the young ones in,
  Down fragrant yellow-tapered paths that thread the prickly whin;
  The hot, sweet smell of oaten-cake, the kettle purring soft,
  The dear-remembered Irish speech--they call to me how oft!

  They mind me just a slip o' girl in tattered kirtle blue,
  But oh they loved me for myself, and not for what I do!
  And never one but had a joy to pass the time of day
  With little Mag o' Monagan's a-laughing down the way.

  There's fifty roofs to shelter me where one was set before,
  But make me free to that again--I'll not be wanting more,
  But sure I know not tears nor gold can turn the years again
  To little Mag o' Monagan's a-singing in the rain.

  CRETONNE TROPICS

  THE cretonne in your willow chair
  Shows through a zone of rosy air,
  A tree of parrots, agate-eyed,
  With blue-green crests and plumes of pride
  And beaks most formidably curved.
  I hear the river, silver-nerved,
  To their shrill protests make reply,
  And the palm forest stir and sigh.

  Curious, the spell that colors cast,
  Binding the fancy coweb-fast,
  And you would smile if you could know
  I like your cretonne parrots so!
  But I have seen them sail toward night
  Superbly homeward, the last light
  Lifting them like a purple sea
  Scorned and made use of arrogantly;
  And I have heard them cry aloud
  From out a tall palm's emerald cloud;
  And I brought home a brilliant feather,
  Lost like a flake of sunset weather.

  Here in the north the sea is white
  And mother-of-pearl in morning light,
  Quite lovely, but there is a glare
  That daunts me.
  Now the willow chair
  Suggests a more perplexing sea,
  Till my heart aches with memory
  And parrots dye the air around,
  And I forget the pallid Sound.
  GRACE HAZARD

  TO HILDA OF HER ROSES

  ENOUGH has been said about roses
  To fill thirty thick volumes;
  There are as many songs about roses
  As there are roses in the world
  That includes Mexico ... the Azores ... Oregon...

  It is a pity your roses
  Are too late for Omar...
  It is a pity Keats has gone...

  Yet there must be something left to say
  Of flowers like these!
  Adventurers,
  They pushed their way
  Through dewy tunnels of the June night
  Now they confer....
  A little tremulous....
  Dazzled by the yellow sea-beach of morning

  If Herrick would tiptoe back...
  If Blake were to look this way
  Ledwidge, even!

  DANDELION

  LITTLE soldier with the golden helmet,
  O What are you guarding on my lawn?
  You with your green gun
  And your yellow beard,
  Why do you stand so stiff?
  There is only the grass to fight!

  HILDA CONKLING


  RED ROOSTER

  RED ROOSTER in your gray coop,
  O stately creature with tail-feathers red and blue,
  Yellow and black,
  You have a comb gay as a parade
  On your head:
  You have pearl trinkets
  On your feet:
  The short feathers smooth along your back
  Are the dark color of wet rocks,
  Or the rippled green of ships
  When I look at their sides through water.
  I don't know how you happened to be made
  So proud, so foolish,
  Wearing your coat of many colors,
  Shouting all day long your crooked words,
  Loud... sharp... not beautiful!

  VELVETS
  (BY A BED OF PANSIES)

  THIS pansy has a thinking face
  Like the yellow moon.
  This one has a face with white blots;
  I call him the clown.
  Here goes one down the grass
  With a pretty look of plumpness;
  She is a little girl going to school
  With her hands in the pockets of her pinafore.
  Her name is Sue.
  I like this one, in a bonnet,
  Waiting,
  Her eyes are so deep!
  But these on the other side,
  These that wear purple and blue,
  They are the Velvets,
  The king with his cloak,
  The queen with her gown,
  The prince with his feather.
  These are dark and quiet
  And stay alone.
  I know you, Velvets,
  Color of Dark,
  Like the pine-tree on the hill
  When stars shine!

  THE MOODS

  THE Moods have laid their hands across my hair:
  The Moods have drawn their fingers through my heart;
  My hair shall never more lie smooth and bright,
  But stir like tide-worn sea-weed, and my heart
  Shall never more be glad of small sweet things,--
  A wild rose, or a crescent moon,-a book
  Of little verses, or a dancing child.
  My heart turns crying from the rose and book,
  My heart turns crying from the thin bright moon,
  And weeps with useless sorrow for the child.
  The Moods have loosed a wind to vex my hair,
  And made my heart too wise, that was a child.

  Now I shall blow like smitten candle-flame:
  I shall desire all things that may not be:
  The years, the stars, the souls of ancient men,
  All tears that must, and smiles that may not be,--
  Yes, glimmering lights across a windy ford,
  And vagrant voices on a darkened plain,
  And holy things, and outcast things, and things,
  Far too remote, frail-bodied to be plain.

  My pity and my joy are grown alike.
  I cannot sweep the strangeness from my heart.
  The Moods have laid swift hands across my hair:
  The Moods have drawn swift fingers through my heart.

  HILL-FANTASY

  SITTETH by the red cairn a brown One, a hoofed One,
  High upon the mountain, where the grasses fail.
  Where the ash-trees flourish far their blazing bunches to the sun,
  A brown One, a hoofed One, pipes against the gale.
  Up scrambled I then, furry fingers helping me.

  I was on the mountain, wandering, wandering;
  No one but the pine trees and the white birch knew.
  Over rocks I scrambled, looked up and saw that Strange Thing,
  Peaked ears and sharp horns, pricked against the blue.

  Oh, and, how he piped there! piped upon the high reeds
  Till the blue air crackled like a frost-film on a pool!
  Oh, and how he spread himself, like a child whom no one heeds,
  Tumbled chuckling in the brook, all sleek and kind and cool!

  He had berries 'twixt his horns, crimson-red as cochineal.,
  Bobbing, wagging wantonly they tickled him, and oh,
  How his deft lips puckered round the reed, seemed to chase and steal
  Sky-music, earth-music, tree-music low!

  I said "Good-day, Thou!" He said, "Good-day, Thou!"
  Wiped his reed against the spotted doe-skin on his back,
  He said, "Come up here, and I will teach thee piping now.
  While the earth is singing so, for tunes we shall not lack."

  Up scrambled I then, furry fingers helping me.
  Up scrambled I. So we sat beside the cairn.
  Broad into my face laughed that horned Thing so naughtily.
  Oh, it was a rascal of a woodland Satyr's bairn!

  'So blow, and so, Thou! Move thy fingers faster, look!
  Move them like the little leaves and whirling midges.  So!
  Soon `twill twist like tendrils and out-twinkle like the lost brook.
  Move thy fingers merrily, and blow! Blow! Blow!"

  Brown One! Hoofed One! Beat time to keep me straight.
  Kick it on the red stone, whistle in my ear.
  Brush thy crimson berries in my face, then hold thy breath, for--wait!
  Joy comes bubbling to me lips. I pipe, oh, hear!

  Blue sky, art glad of us? Green wood, art glad of us?
  Old hard-heart mountain, dost thou hear me, how I blow?
  Far away the sea-isles swim in sun-haze luminous.
  Each one has a color like the seven-splendor bow.

  Wind, wind, wind, dost thou mind me how I pipe, Now?
  Chipmunk chatt'ring in the beech, rabbit in the brake?
  Furry arm around my neck: "Oh, Thou art a brave one, Thou!"
  Satyr, little satyr-friend, my heart with joy doth ache!

  Sky-music, earth-music, tree-music tremulous,
  Water over steaming rocks, water in the shade,
  Storm-tune and sun-tune, how they flock up unto us,
  Sitting by the red cairn, gay and unafraid!

  Brown One, Hoofed One, give me nimble hoofs, Thou!
  Give me furry fingers and a secret furry tail!
  Pleasant are thy smooth horns: if their like were on my brow
  Might I not abide here, till the strong sun fail?

  Oh, the sorry brown eyes!  Oh, the soft kind hand-touch,
  Sudden brush of velvet ears across my wind-cool cheek!
  "Play-mate, Pipe-mate, thou askest one good boon too much.
  I could never find thee horns, though day-long I seek.

  "Yet, keep the pipe, Thou: I will cut another one.
  Keep the pipe and play on it for all the world to hear.
  Ah, but it was good once to sit together in the sun!
  Though I have but half a soul, it finds thee very dear!

  "Wise Thing, Mortal Thing, yet my half-soul fears thee!
  Take the pipe and go thy ways,--quick now, for the sun
  Reels across the hot west and stumbles dazzled to the sea.
  Take the pipe, and oh-one kiss! then run, run, run! run!"

  Silence on the mountain.  Lonely stands the high cairn,
  All the leaves a-shivering, all the stones dead-gray.
  O thou cold small pipe, which way is fled that Satyr's bairn?
  I am lost and all alone, and down drops the day.

  I was on the mountain, wandering, wandering
  There I got this Pipe o' dreams.  Strange, when I blow,
  Something deep as human love starts a-crying, troubling.
  Is it only sky-music, earth-music low?

  FANNIE STEARNS DAVIS


  THE MIRAGE

  ACROSS the Bay are low-lying cliffs,
  Where stand fishermen's cottages:
  I can barely distinguish them with the naked eye.
  But to-day the cliffs are lifted, escarpt,
  Perpendicular, mysterious, inaccessible,
  And those sordid dwellings have become
  The magnificent fortified castles of Sea-kings.

  THE ROAD BEYOND THE TOWN

  A ROAD goes up a pleasant hill,
  And a little house looks down:
  Ah! but I see the roadway still
  And the day I left the town.

  The day I left my father's home,
  It's many a year ago,
  And a heart and hope were brave to roam
  the long, long road I know.

  The long, long road by hill and plain,
  It's tired the heart might be:

  But hope stayed bright in sun or rain,
  And a Voice that called to me.

  A Voice that called me over the hill
  And out of the little town:
  Ah! but I see the roadway still.
  And the good house looking down.

  The house that spake me never a No!
  As I started brave away,
  But said with a blessing, Go!
  And followed me every day.

  It followed me down the road of years,
  For a father's heart is true,
  And joy is sweet in a mother's tears
  For the deeds her child may do.

  The poor little deeds, all powerless
  For the Kingdom of God would be,

  Save in His mercy will He bless
  The road that goes with me:

  The road that left a pleasant hill,
  Where a little house looks down:
  Ah! but I bless the roadway still,
  And the land beyond the town.

  MICHAEL EARLS, S.J.


  THE LILAC

  THE scent of lilac in the air
  Hath made him drag his steps and pause
  Whence comes this scent within the Square,
  Where endless dusty traffic roars?
  A push-cart stands beside the curb,
  With fragrant blossoms laden high;
  Speak low, nor stare, lest we disturb
  His sudden reverie!

  He sees us not, nor heeds the din
  Of clanging car and scuffling throng;
  His eyes see fairer sights within,
  And memory hears the robin's song
  As once it trilled against the day,
  And shook his slumber in a room
  Where drifted with the breath of May
  The lilac's sweet perfume.

  The heart of boyhood in him stirs;
  The wonder of the morning skies,
  Of sunset gold behind the firs,
  Is kindled in his dreaming eyes:
  How far off is this sordid place,
  As turning from our sight away
  He crushes to his hungry face
  A purple lilac spray.

  WALTER PRICHARD EATON



  GOD, THROUGH HIS OFFSPRING NATURE,
  GAVE ME LOVE

  GOD, through his offspring Nature, gave me love,
  Though man in opposition saith me nay,
  And taketh from my heart its life to-day,
  As through the valley of the world I rove.
  Still unaccompanied, within the grove
  That doth enamored beings hold at play,
  My spirit must pursue its lonely way,
  And strive to pluck some flowers that bloom above.
  Oh, wherefore then doth Nature give desire
  To have that which mankind may not possess,
  And force him to endure on earth hell's fire,
  And live in one perpetual distress?
  Some evil power must such love inspire,
  And with it masquerade in Cupid's dress!

  TO MUSIC

  "Music, the language, the atmosphere of the Soul."

  FLY back where Melodies like lilies grow,
  My weary heart is bending low;

  Fly higher yet to joyful realms above,
  Where holy Angels dwell in love.

  Fly higher still and hear the Angel throng
  And bring to me their Glory-song:

  Ah Music, thou and I above the World
  May dwell where heaven with shining song is pearled!

  While Sun and Moon and all the planets roll
  I'll love thee, Music, language of my soul!

  Music-lark from on high, song that doth fly,
  Spark of the sky!

  MAUDE GORDON-ROBY



  THE VOICE IN THE SONG

  HIGH in the apple bough jauntily swinging,
  Hid by the branches in bridal array,
  Straight from his heart, all his life in his singing,
  Chants a wee bird, lures his mate with his lay.
  "Sweet, sweet, my sweet,
  Hear I entreat!
  Say, love, together, this bright sunny weather,
  Gold of the west we shall weave in a nest!
  Have no fear! Trust me, dear!
  Sunshine of May that will gild every day
  Pledge I to thee if thou'lt harken to me."

  Lo! in the light thro' the gay branches streaming,
  Quivering in answer to all the bird sings,
  Warm on a breath, leaps a soul with love gleaming,
  Speeds to its mate on its glittering wings.
  "Dear, on thy breast
  Earth yields its best!
  Loud in the singing I heard thy call ringing,
  Pleading and strong in the voice of the song,
  Whisper low,--Yes, just so!--
  Softly revealing the depth of thy feeling,
  Words in whose fire glow thy love and desire."

  HYMNS AND ANTHEMS SUNG AT
  WELLESLEY COLLEGE

  I

  MOUNT CARMEL

  WHERE art Thou, O my Lord?
  Mount Carmel saw the throng
  Of priests and heard the song;
  To Baal was their call--
  From morn till night did fall.

  Where art Thou, O my Lord?
  Again Mount Carmel heard
  Not in the spoken word,
  Not in the earthquake's shock,
  Not in the thunder roll,
  But in the inmost soul.

  II

  VESPER HYMN

  Send peaceful sleep, O Lord, this night,
  To keep us till the morning light;
  And let no vision of alarm
  Come near to do Thy children harm


  Within Thy circling arms we lie,
  O God, in Thine infinity;

  Our souls in quiet shall abide
  Beset with love on every side.

  III

  THIS IS THAT BREAD

This is that Bread that came down from Heaven,
he that eateth of this Bread shall live forever.

  Bread on which angels feed,
  Bread for the spirit's need
  By faith receiving,
  New life do Thou impart,
  New strength to every heart,
  Pure love of God Thou art
  To us believing.

  IV

  O SLOW OF HEART

O slow of heart to believe!  Ought Christ not to
have suffered these things and to enter into His Glory?

  Quicken, Lord, my fainting heart,
  Touch my eyes that they may see,
  Let me know Thee as Thou art.
  Life and Immortality.

  ALL HAIL TO THEE, CHILD JESUS

  All hail to Thee, child Jesus!
  As the brooding darkness flies
  At the swift approach of day,
  Sun of righteousness, arise,
  Chase the gloom of night away.
  Great Prince of Peace, come to thine own,
  And build in every heart Thy throne.

  Come to shed Thy healing balm
  On all nations of the earth,
  Child Jesus, come with holy calm,
  How we hail thy wondrous birth.
  Great Prince of Peace, come to Thine own,
  And build in every heart Thy throne.
  All hail to Thee, Child Jesus!

  VI

  THE WINE-PRESS

  Who is this that comes from Edom
  In such glorious array,
  With his festal garments gleaming,
  Travelling on his royal way
  With a face majestic, calm and grave?
  I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.

  Why is thy apparel crimson,
  Why is all thy garments' pride
  Stained as in the time of vintage
  And with blood-red-color dyed?
  Because of helpers I had none--
  I have trodden the wine-press alone.

  VII

  WAKEN, SHEPHERDS!

  (Angels) Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna!
  (Shepherds) Waken, Shepherds, waken;
    Whence this glowing light?
    Ere the dawn of morning,
    Solemn signs of warning
    Portent of affright!

  (Angels) Courage, Shepherds, courage!
    Banish your dismay,
    or ye all are saved.
    In the town of David
    Christ is born to-day.

  (Shepherds) Harken, Shepherds, harken,
    Hear the angels sing!
    Jehovah sends a token,
    He himself hath spoken
    To proclaim our King.

  (Angels) Hasten, Shepherds, hasten,
    This shall be your sign;
    Where the kine are stabled,
    In a manger cradled
    Lies the Child Divine.

  (Shepherds and Angels) Angels, Shepherds, People,
    Shout the glad refrain!
    Joy to every nation
    Bringing full salvation,
    Christ has come to reign.
    Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna!

  CAROLINE HAZARD



  REUBEN ROY

  LITTLE fellow, brown with wind--
  I saw him in the street
  Peering at numbers on the posts,
  But most discreet:

  For when a woman came outdoors,
  Or slyly peeped instead,
  He turned away, took off his hat,
  And scratched his head.

  I watched him from my garden-wall
  Perhaps an hour or more,
  For something in his attitude,
  The clothes he wore,

  Awoke the dimmest memories
  Of when I was a boy
  And knew the story of a man
  Named Reuben Roy.

  It seems that Reuben went to sea
  The night his wife decried
  The fence he built before their house
  And up the side.

  He wanted it but she did not,
  Because it hid from view
  The spot in which her mignonette
  And tulips grew.

  Nobody saw his face again,
  But each year, unawares,
  He sent a sum for taxes due--
  And fence repairs.

  My curiosity aroused,

  I sauntered forth to see
  Whether this individual
  Were really he.

  "Who are you looking for?" I asked
  His eyes, like two bright pence,
  Sparkled at mine; and then he said:
  "A fence."

  "Somebody burned it Hallowe'en,
  When people were in bed;
  Before the judge could prosecute,
  The culprit fled."

  Well, Reuben only touched his hat
  And mumbled, "Thank you, Sir,"
  And asked me whereabouts to find
  A carpenter.

  COUNTRY ROAD

  I CAN'T forget a gaunt grey barn
  Like a face without an eye
  That kept recurring by field and tarn
  Under a Cape Cod sky.

  I can't forget a woman's hand,
  Roughened and scarred by toil
  That beckoned clear-eyed children tanned
  By sun and wind and soil.

  Beauty and hardship, bent and bound
  Under the selfsame yoke:
  Babies with bare knees plump and round
  And stooping women folk.

  WREATHS

  RED wreaths
  Hang in my neighbor's window,
  Green wreaths in my own.
  On this day I lost my husband.
  On this day you lost your boy.
  On this day
  Christ was born.
  Red wreaths,
  Green wreaths
  Hang in Our Windows
  Red for a bleeding heart,
  Green for grave grass.
  Mary, mother of Jesus,
  Look down and comfort us.
  You too knew passion;
  You too knew pain.
  Comfort us,
  Who are not brides of God,
  Nor bore God.
  On Christmas day
  Hang wreaths,
  Red for new pain.
  Green for spent passion.

  MEMPHIS

  WHY should I sing of my present?  It is nothing to me or you,

  Rather I'd dream of Dixie and tie ships on the old bayou!
  Rather I'd dream of my packets and the lazy river days,
  Rather I'd dream of my levee and the crimson sunset haze,

  Rather I'd dream of my triumphs, of the days that are long gone by,
  Rather I'd dream of flame-tipped stacks against a saffron sky,
  Of level lawns of topaz, of level fields of jade,
  Of the rambling pillared mansions that my fathers' fathers made!

  Why should I sing of my present?  It is nothing to you or me,
  But the river road, the great road, the high road to the sea!
  Aye, that is worth the dreaming, aye, that was worth the pain.
  Send me back my river, and I shall wake again!

  GORDON MALHERBE HILLMAN


  SAINT COLUMBKILLE

  COLUMBKILLE!  Saint Columbkille!
  You naughty man, Saint Columbkille!
  Why did you Finnian's Psalter take
  And secretly a copy make?
  You know 'twas such a naughty thing
  For one descended from a king
  To lock himself into a cell,
  'Twas far from right,-you knew it well,--
  And copy Finnian's Psalter through,
  Against his will as well you knew.
  And then to think a common bird
  Should feel such shame, that when he heard
  The breathing spy outside your door,
  And felt your sainthood was no more,
  Should through the crack attack the spy,
  And in a rage pluck out his eye,
  As if that saintly Irish crane
  Would hide from all your Saintship's stain.
  I grieve to think that you did add
  Sin unto sin; it is too bad.
  For Finnian could not you persuade
  To yield the copy that you made,
  Until the King in his behalf
  Ruled-"To each cow belongs her calf":
  And then you grew so mad you swore
  On Erin's face you'd look no more.
  And crossed the sea the Picts to save,
  Because you so did misbehave
  To dear Saint Finnian: faith, 'twas ill
  For you to act so, Columbkille!
  A saint you were no doubt, no doubt!
  What pity 'twas you were found out!
  We know an angel (snob or fool?)


  To Kiaran showed a common rule,
  An axe, an auger, and a saw,
  And told that saint it was the law
  Of Heaven that Columbkille should be
  Far, far above such saints as he;
  For Columbkille contemned a crown,
  While he these homely tools laid down,
  To serve the Lord, and that the Lord
  To each would give his due reward.
  I wonder if that angel knew
  That Christ these tools had laid down too.
  O Columbkille! O Columbkille!
  A saint like you must have his will,
  But for myself I'd rather be
  The common sinner that you see
  Than make a crane ashamed of me,
  And angels talk such idiocy.

  MISS DOANE

  MISS Doane was sixty, probably;
  She rented third floor room
  That opened on an airshaft full
  Of cooking smells and gloom.

  She worked in philanthropic man's
  Well-known department store;
  Cashiered in basement, hot and close,
  For forty years or more.

  Each night when she came home she'd stand
  A moment in the hall,
  Before she went into her room
  With low and tender call.

  And often I would hear her voice
  Repeat a childish prayer;
  Or read some old, old fairy tale
  Of Princess, grand and fair.

  One night I went to visit her
  And spied, in little chair
  A great wax doll, in dainty dress,
  And curls of flaxen hair.

  I praised the doll; its prettiness;
  Miss Doane said, "I'm alone.
  She comforts me. I wanted so
  A child to call my own."


  Each night I heard her softly sing
  A childish lullaby;
  But once, and just before she died,
  I heard her cry and cry!

  FALLEN FENCES

  THE woods grew dark; black shadows
  rocked
  And I could scarcely see
  My way along the old tote road,
  That long had seemed to me

  To wind on aimlessly; but now
  Came full to life; the rain
  Would soon strike down; ahead I saw
  A clearing, and a lane

  Between gray, fallen fences and
  Wide, grayer, grim stone walls;
  So grim and gray I shrank from thought
  Of weary, aching spalles.

  On stony knoll great aspens swayed
  And swung in browsing teeth
  Of wind; slim, silvered yearlings shook
  And shivered underneath.

  Beyond, some ancient oak trees bent
  And wrangled over roof
  Of weatherbeaten house, and barn
  Whose sag bespoke no hoof.

  And ivy crawled up either end
  Of house, to chimney, where
  It lashed in futile anger at
  The wind wolves of the air.

  I thought the house abandoned, and
  I ran to get inside,
  When suddenly the old front door
  was opened and flung wide

  And she stood there, with hand on knob,
  As I went swiftly in,
  Then closed the door most softly on
  The storm and shrieking din.

  A space I stood and looked at her,
  So young; 'twas passing strange
  That fifty years or more had gone
  And brought no new style's change.

  The sweetness, daintiness of her
  In starched and dotted gown
  Of creamy whiteness, over hoops,
  With ruffles winding down!

  We had not much to say, and yet
  Of words I felt no lack;
  Her smiles slipped into dimples, stopped
  A moment, then dropped back.

  I felt her pride of race; her taste
  In silken rug and chair,
  And quaintly fashioned furniture
  Of patterns old and rare.

  On window sill a rose bush stood;
  'Twas bringing rose to bud;
  One full bloomed there but yesterday,
  Dropped petals, red as blood.

  Quite soon, she asked to be excused
  For just a moment, and
  Went out, returning with a tray
  In either slender hand.

  My glance could not but linger on
  Each thin and lovely cup;
  "This came, dear thing, from home!" she sighed
  The while she raised it up.

  And when the storm was done and I
  Arose, reluctantly
  To go, she too was loath to have
  Me go, it seemed to me.

  When I reached old Joe Webber's place,
  Upon the Corner Road,
  I went into the Upper Field
  Where Joe, round-shouldered, hoed

  Potatoes, culling them with hoe
  And practised, calloused hand,
  In rounded piles that brownly glowed
  Upon the fresh-turned land.

  "Say, Joe," I said, "who is that girl
  With beauty's smiling charm,
  That lives beyond that hemlock growth,
  On that old grown-up farm?"

  Joe listened, while I told him where
  I'd been that afternoon,
  Then straightened from his hoe, and hummed,
  Before he spoke, a tune

  "They cum ter thet old place ter live
  Some sixty years ago;
  Jest where they cum from, who they ware,
  Wy, no one got to know.

  "An' then, one day, he hired Hen's
  Red racker an' the gig;
  We never heard from him nor could
  We track the hoss or rig.

  "Hen waited 'bout a week, an' then
  He went ter see the Wife;
  He found her in thet settin' room:
  She'd taken of her life.

  "An' no one's lived in thet house sence;
  Some say 'tis haunted,-but
  I ain't no use fer foolishness,
  So all I say's tut! tut!"

  WINIFRED VIRGINIA JACKSON


  CROSS-CURRENTS

  THEY wrapped my soul in eiderdown;
  They placed me warm and snug
  In carved chair; set me with care
  Upon an old prayer rug.

  They cased my feet in golden shoes
  That hurt at toe and heel;
  My restless feet, with youth all fleet,
  Nor asked how they might feel.

  And now they wonder where I am,
  And search with shrill, cold cry;
  But I crouch low where tall reeds grow,
  And smile as they pass by!

  WINIFRED VIRGINIA JACKSON



  THE FAREWELL

  WHAT is more beautiful
  Than thought, soul-fed,
  That I may be the crimson of a rose
  When dead?

  My soul, so light a joy
  And grief will be,
  That it will gently press the brown earth down
  On me.

  WINIFRED VIRGINIA JACKSON


  SONG

  LET me be great, as stars are great,
  Singing of love, not of hate.

  Love for sweet and simple things,
  Like clouds and sea-shell whisperings,

  Cool autumn winds, pale dew-kissed flowers,
  Thin coils of smoke and granite towers,

  Snow-capped mountain peaks that flash
  High above a river's crash,

  Shrill songs of birds and children's laughter,
  Soft grey shadows trailing after

  Sunbeam sprites that seek the woods
  And lose themselves in solitudes.

  All these I'll love, never hate,
  And loving them, I will be great.

  OLIVER JENKINS



  LOVE AUTUMNAL

  MY love will come in autumn-time
  When leaves go spinning to the ground
  And wistful stars in heaven chime
  With the leaves' sound.

  Then, we shall walk through dusty lanes
  And pause beneath low-hanging boughs,
  And there, while soft-hued beauty reigns
  We'll make our vows.

  Let others seek in spring for sighs
  When love flames forth from every seed;
  But love that blooms when nature dies
  Is love indeed!

  OLIVER JENKINS


  ECHOS

  TRAVELING at dusk the noisy city street,
  I listened to the newsboys' strident cries
  Of "Extra," as with flying feet,
  They strove to gain this man or that-their prize.
  But one there was with neither shout nor stride,
  And, having bought from him, I stood nearby,
  Pondering the cruel crutches at his side,
  Blaming the crowd's neglect, and wondering why--

  When suddenly I heard a gruff voice greet
  The cripple with "On time to-night?"
  Then, as he handed out the sheet,
  The Youngster's answer-"You're all right.
  My other reg'lars are a little late.
  They'll find I'm short one paper when they come;
  You see, a strange guy bought one in the wait,
  I tho't 'twould cheer him up-he looked so glum!"

  So, sheepishly I laughed, and went my way
  For I had found a city's heart that day.

  WAR PICTURES

  "GERMAN Retreat From Arras"
  "Official Films"-they came
  After "Corinne and Her Minstrels"
  Had ministered to fame.

  After "Corinne and Her Minstrels"
  Had pigeon-toed away,
  We saw where bits of churches
  And bits of horses lay.

  We saw bleak desolation;
  We saw no unscathed tree.
  We shivered in our comfort
  And murmured: "Can it be!"

  But later, walking homeward,
  Repeating: "Is it true?"
  We brushed a khaki shoulder
  And asked no more.  We knew!

  RUTH LAMBERT JONES


  AN OLD SONG

  WHEN I was but a young lad,
  And that is long ago,
  I thought that luck loved every man,
  And time his only foe,
  And love was like a hawthorn bush
  That blossomed every May,
  And had but to choose his flower,
  For that's the young lad's way.

  Oh, youth's a thriftless squanderer,
  It's easy come and spent,
  And heavy is the going now
  Where once the light foot went.
  The hawthorn bush puts on its white,
  The throstle whistles clear,
  But Spring comes once for every man
  Just once in all the year.

  ARTHUR KETCHUM


  ROADSIDE REST

  SUCH quiet sleep has come to them!
  The Springs and Autumns pass,
  Nor do they know if it be snow
  Or daisies in the grass.

  All day the birches bend to hear
  The river's undertone;
  Across the hush a fluting thrush
  Sings even-song alone.

  But down their dream there drifts no sound,
  The winds may sob and stir:
  On the still breast of Peace they rest
  And they are glad of her.

  They ask not any gift--they mind
  Nor any foot that fares,
  Unheededly life passes by--
  Such quiet sleep is theirs.

  ARTHUR KETCHUM


  OLD LIZETTE ON SLEEP

  BED is the boon for me!
  It's well to bake and sweep,
  But hear the word of old Lizette:
  It's better than all to sleep.

  Summer and flowers are gay,
  And morning light and dew;
  But aged eyelids love the dark
  Where never a light peeps through.

  What!--open-eyed, my dears?
  Thinking your hearts will break.
  There's nothing, nothing, nothing, I say,
  That's worth the lying awake!

  I learned it in my youth--
  Love I was dreaming of!
  I learned it from the needle-work
  That took the place of love.
  I learned it from the years
  And what they brought about;
  From song, and from the hills of joy
  Where sorrow sought me out.

  It's good to dream and turn,
  And turn and dream, or fall
  To comfort with my pack of bones,
  And know of nothing at all!

  Yes, never know at all!
  If prowlers mew or bark,
  Nor wonder if it's three o'clock
  Or four o'clock of the dark.

  When the longer shades have fallen
  And the last weariness
  Has brought the sweetest gift of life,
  The last forgetfulness.

  If a sound as of old leaves
  Stir the last bed I keep,
  Then say, my dears: "It's old Lizette--
  She's turning in her sleep!"

  AGNES LEE



  MOTHERHOOD

  MARY, the Christ long slain, passed silently.
  Following the children joyously astir
  Under the cedrus and the olive tree,
  Pausing to let their laughter float to her.
  Each voice an echo of a voice more dear,
  She saw a little Christ in every face;
  When lo, another woman, gliding near,
  Yearned o'er the tender life that filled the place.
  And Mary sought the woman's hand, and spoke:
  "I know thee not, yet know thy memory tossed
  With all a thousand dreams their eyes evoke
  Who bring to thee a child beloved and lost.

  "I, too, have rocked my little one,
  O, He was fair!
  Yea, fairer than the fairest sun,
  And like its rays through amber spun
  His sun-bright hair.
  Still I can see it shine and shine."
  "Even so," the woman said, "was mine."

  "His ways were ever darling ways,"--
  And Mary smiled,--
  "So soft, so clinging! Glad relays
  Of love were all His precious days.
  My little child!
  My infinite star!  My music fled!"
  "Even so was mine," the woman said.

  Then whispered Mary: "Tell me, thou,
  Of thine." And she:
  "O, mine was rosy as a boug

  Blooming with roses, sent, somehow,
  To bloom for me!
  His balmy fingers left a thrill
  Within my breast that warms me still."

  Then gazed she down some wilder, darker hour,
  And said, when Mary questioned, knowing not,
  "Who art thou, mother of so sweet a flower?"
  "I am the mother of Iscariot."

  ESSEX

  I

  THY hills are kneeling in the tardy spring,
  And wait, in supplication's gentleness,
  The certain resurrection that shall bring
  A robe of verdure for their nakedness.
  Thy perfumed valleys where the twilights dwell,
  Thy fields within the sunlight's living coil

  Now promise, while the veins of nature swell,
  Eternal recompense to human toil.
  And when the sunset's final shades depart
  The aspiration to completed birth
  Is sweet and silent; as the soft tears start,
  We know how wanton and how little worth
  Are all the passions of our bleeding heart
  That vex the awful patience of the earth.

  II

  Thine are the large winds and the splendid sun
  Glutting the spread of heaven to the floor
  Of waters rhythmic from far shore to shore,
  And thine the stars, revealing one by one,
  Thine the grave, lucent night's oblivion,
  The tawny moon that waits below the skies,--
  Strange as the dawn that smote their blistered eyes
  Who watched from Calvary when the Deed was done.
  And thine the good brown earth that bares its breast
  To thy benign October, thine the trees
  Lusty with fruitage in the late year's rest;


  And thine the men whos@ blood has glorified
  Thy name with Liberty Is divine decrees--
  The men who loved thy soil and fought and died.

  III

  Toward thine Eastern window when the morn
  Steals through the silver mesh of silent stars,
  I come unlaurelled from the strenuous wars
  Where men have fought and wept and died
  Forlorn.

  But here, across the early fields of corn,
  The living silence dwelleth, and the gray
  Sweet earth-mist, while afar the lisp of spray
  Breathes from the ocean like a Triton's horn.
  Open thy lattice, for the gage is won
  For which this earth has journeyed though the dust
  Of shattered systems, cold about the sun;
  And proved by sin, by mighty lives impearled,
  A voice cries through the sunrise: "Time is Just!"--
  And falls like dew God's pity on the world

  GEORGE CABOT LODGE



  THE SONG OF THE WAVE

  This is the song of the wave! The mighty one!
  Child of the soul of silence, beating the air to sound:
  White as a live terror, as a drawn sword,
  This is the wave.

  II

  This is the song of the wave, the white-maned steed of the Tempest
  Whose veins are swollen with life,
  In whose flanks abide the four winds.
  This is the wave.

  III

  This is the song of the wave!  The dawn leaped out of the sea
  And the waters lay smooth as a silver shield,
  And the sun-rays smote on the waters like a golden sword.
  Then a wind blew out of the morning
  And the waters rustled
  And the wave was born!

  IV

  This is the song of the wave! The wind blew out of the noon
  And the white sea-birds like driven foam
  Winged in from the ocean that lay beyond the sky
  And the face of the waters was barred with white,
  For the wave had many brothers,
  And the wave was strong!

  V

  This is the song of the wave! The wind blew out of the sunset
  And the west was lurid as Hell.
  The black clouds closed like a tomb, for the sun was dead.
  Then the wind smote full as the breath of God,
  And the wave called to its brothers,
  "This is the crest of life!"

  VI

  This is the song of the wave, that rises to fall,
  Rises a sheer green wall like a barrier of glass
  That has caught the soul of the moonlight.
  Caught and prisoned the moon-beams;
  Its edge is frittered to foam.
  This is the wave!

  VII

  This is the song of the wave, of the wave that falls--
  Wild as a burst of day-gold blown through the colours of morning
  It shivers to infinite atoms up the rumbling steep of sand.
  This is the wave.

  VIII

  This is the song of the wave that died in the fullness of life.
  The prodigal this, that lavished its largess of strength
  In the lust of attainment.
  Aiming at things for Heaven too high,
  Sure in the pride of life, in the richness of strength.
  So tried it the impossible height, till the end was found:
  Where ends the soul that yearns for the fillet of morning stars,
  The soul in the toils of the journeying worlds,
  Whose eye is filled with the Image of God,
  And the end is Death!

  GEORGE CABOT LODGE



  FRIMAIRE

  DEAREST, we are like two flowers
  Blooming in the garden,
  A purple aster flower and a red one
  Standing alone in a withered desolation.

  The garden plants are shattered and seeded,
  One brittle leaf scrapes against another,
  Fiddling echoes of a rush of petals.
  Now only you and I nodding together.

  Many were with us; they have all faded.
  Only we are purple and crimson,
  Only we in the dew-clear mornings,
  Smarten into color as the sun rises.

  When I scarcely see you in the flat moonlight,
  And later when my cold roots tighten,
  I am anxious for morning,
  I cannot rest in fear of what may happen.

  You or I-and I am a coward.
  Surely frost should take the crimson.
  Purple is a finer color,

  Very splendid in isolation.

  So we nod above the broken
  Stems of flowers almost rotted.
  Many mornings there cannot be now
  For us both.  Ah, Dear, I love you!

  AMY LOWELL


  PATTERNS

  I WALK down the garden paths,
  And all the daffodils
  Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.
  I walk down the patterned garden paths
  In my stiff, brocaded gown.
  With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,
  I too am a rare
  Pattern.  As I wander down
  The garden paths.

  My dress is richly figured,
  And the train
  Makes a pink and silver stain
  On the gravel, and the thrift
  Of the borders.
  Just a plate of current fashion,
  Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.
  Not a softness anywhere about me,
  Only a whale-bone and brocade.

  And I sink on a seat in the shade
  Of a lime tree.  For my passion
  Wars against the stiff brocade.
  The daffodils and squills
  Flutter in the breeze
  As they please.
  And I weep;
  For the lime tree is in blossom
  And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.


  And the splashing of waterdrops
  In the marble fountain
  Comes down the garden paths.
  The dripping never stops.
  Underneath my stiffened gown
  Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,
  A basin in the midst of hedges grown
  So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,
  But she guesses he is near,
  And the sliding of the water
  Seems the stroking of a dear
  Hand upon her.
  What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!
  I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.
  All the pink and silver crumpled up upon the ground.

  I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,
  And he would stumble after,
  Bewildered by my laughter.
  I should see the sun flashing from his sword hilt and the buckles
      on his shoes.
  I would choose
  To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,
  A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,
  Till he caught me in the shade,
  And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,
  Aching, melting, unafraid.
  With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,
  And the plopping of the waterdrops,
  All about us in the open afternoon--
  I am very like to swoon
  With the weight of this brocade,
  For the sun sifts through the shade.

  Underneath the fallen blossom
  In my bosom,
  Is a letter I have hid.
  It was brought to me this morning by a rider from
  the Duke.
  "Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell
  Died in action Thursday sen'night."
  As I read it in the white morning sunlight.
  The letters squirmed like snakes.
  "Any answer, Madam," said my footman.
  "No," I told him.
  "See that the messenger takes some refreshment.
  No, no answer."
  And I walked into the garden,
  Up and down the patterned paths,
  In my stiff, correct brocade.
  The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in
  the sun,
  Each one.
  I stood upright too,
  Held rigid to the pattern
  By the stiffness of my gown.
  Up and down I walked,
  Up and down.

  In a month he would have been my husband,
  In a month, here, underneath this lime,
  We would have broke the pattern;
  He for me, and I for him,
  He as Colonel, I as lady,
  On this shady seat.
  He had a whim
  That sunlight carried blessing.
  And I answered, "It shall be as you have said."


  Now he is dead.


  In Summer and in Winter I shall walk
  Up and down
  The patterned garden paths
  In my stiff, brocaded gown.
  The squills and the daffodils
  Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.


  I shall go
  Up and down,
  In my gown.
  Gorgeously arrayed,
  Boned and stayed.
  And the softness of my body will be guarded from
  embrace
  By each button, hook and lace.
  For the man who should loose me is dead,
  Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,
  In a pattern called a war.
  Christ! What are patterns for?

  AMY LOWELL


  A BATHER

  THICK dappled by circles of sunshine and fluttering shade.
  Your bright, naked body advances, blown over by leaves,
  Half-quenched in their various green, just a point
  Of you showing,
  A knee or a thigh, sudden glimpsed, then at once
  Blotted into
  The filmy and flickering forest, to start out again
  Triumphant in smooth, supple roundness, edged
  Sharp as white ivory,
  Cool, perfect, with rose rarely tinting your lips and
  Your breasts,
  Swelling out from the green in the opulent curves
  Of ripe fruit,
  And hidden, like fruit, by the swift intermittence
  Of leaves.
  So, clinging to branches and moss, you advance on the ledges
  Of rock which hang over the stream, with the wood-smells about you,
  The pungence of strawberry plants and of gum-oozing spruces,
  While below runs the water impatient, impatient to take you,
  To splash you, to run down your sides, to sing you of deepness,
  Of pools brown and golden, with brown-and-gold flags on their borders,
  Of blue, lingering skies floating solemnly over your beauty,
  Of undulant waters a-sway in the effort to hold you

  To keep you submerged and quiescent while over you glories
  The summer.
  Oread, Dryad, or Naiad, or just
  Woman, clad only in youth and in gallant perfection,
  Standing up in a great burst of sunshine, you dazzle my eyes
  Like a snow-star, a moon, your effulgence burns up in a halo,
  For you are the chalice which holds all the races of men.
  You slip into the pool and the water folds over your shoulder,
  And over the tree-tops the clouds slowly follow
  your swimming, To behold the way they act.
  And the scent of the woods is sweet on this hot
  summer morning.

  AMY LOWELL


  LEPRECHAUNS AND CLURICAUNS
  OVER where the Irish hedges
  Are with blossoms white as snow,
  Over where the limestone ledges
  Through the soft green grasses show--
  There the fairies may be seen
  In their jackets of red and green,
  Leprechauns and cluricauns,
  And the other ones, I ween.

  And, bedad, it is a wonder
  To behold the way they act.
  They're the lads that seldom blunder,
  Wise and wary, that's the fact.
  You may hold them with your eye;
  Look away and off they fly;
  Leprechauns and cluricauns,
  Bedad, but they are sly!

  They have heaps of golden treasure
  Hid away within the ground,
  Where they spend their days in leisure,
  And where fairy joys abound;
  But to mortals not a guinea
  Will they give-no, not a penny.
  Leprechauns and cluricauns,
  Their gold is seldom found.

  Maybe of a morning early
  As you pass a lonely rath,
  You may see a little curly--
  Headed fairy in your path.
  He'll be working at a shoe,

  But he'll have his eye on you--
  Leprechauns and cluricauns,
  They know just what to do.

  Visions of a life of riches
  Surely will before you flash;
  (You'll no longer dig the ditches,
  You'll be well supplied with cash.)
  And you'll seize the little man,
  And you'll hold him--if you can;
  Leprechauns and cluricauns,
  'Tis they're the slipp'ry clan!

  DENIS A. MCCARTHY


  L'ENVOI

  WHEN the time for parting comes, and the day is on the wane,
  And the silent evening darkens over hill and over plain,
  And earth holds no more sorrow, no more grief, and no more pain,
  Shall we weary for the battle and the strife?

  When at last the trail is ending, and the stars are growing near,
  And we breathe the breath of conquest, and the voices that we hear
  Are the great companions' voices that have hallowed year on year,
  Shall we know an instant's grieving as we pass?

  Shall we pause a fleeting moment ere we grasp the eager hands,
  Take one last long look of wonder at the dimming of the lands,
  Love the earth one glowing moment ere we pass from its demands,
  Cull all beauty in its essence as we gaze?

  Or with not one backward longing shall we leap the last abyss,
  Scale the highest crags glad-hearted, fearful only lest the bliss
  Of an earth-remembering instant should delay the great sun's kiss--
  Consuming us within the flame?

  TO IMAGINATION
  SUGGESTED BY MAXFIELD PARRISH'S "AIR CASTLES"

  O BEAUTEOUS boy a-dream, what visions
  sought
  Of pictures magical thy eyes unfold,
  What triumphs of celestial wonders wrought,
  What marvels from a breath of beauty rolled!
  Skyward and seaward on the clouds are scrolled,
  A mystic imagery of castled thought,
  A thousand worlds to lose,--or win and mould--
  A radiant iridescence swiftly caught
  Of ever-changing glory, fancy-fraught.

  Blue wonder of the sea and luminous sky,
  A thousand wonders in thy dreamlit face,--
  Eyes that behold afar the turrets high
  Of Ilium, and the transient mortal grace
  Of Deirdre's sadness, all the conquering race
  Of Athens,--eyes that saw Eden's beauty lie
  In passionate adoration--visions trace
  Across the tender brooding of the sigh
  That wrecked a city and made chieftains die.

  Forward not backward turns the mystic shine
  Of those far-seeing orbs that track the gleam--
  The fleecy marvel of the cloud is line
  On line the wizard tracery of a dream.
  O lad, who buildest not of things that seem,
  Beyond what bounds of visioning divine
  Came that far smile, from what long-strayed sun-beam
  Caught thou the radiance, from what fostering vine
  The power to build and mould the deep design?

  Knowest thou the secret that thy brush would tell,
  Is all the dream a bubbled splendor white,
  Beyond those castles cloud-bound, does there dwell
  The eternal silence of the dark--or light?
  Will thy hand hold the pen which shall indict
  The symboled mystery-write the final knell
  Of rainbow fancy-is the distant sight
  A nothingless encircled by a spell
  Of gleaming bubbles wrought of beauty's shell?

  In vain to question, where the mystery
  Of Youth's short golden dream is lord and king.
  The eyes that farthest gaze in ecstasy,
  Were never meant to paint the immortal thing
  They see, nor understand the joy they bring.
  The misty baubles of the sky and sea
  Sail on.  Dream still, bright-visioned boy, and fling
  The glittering mantle of thy thoughts that flee,
  Weaving us evermore thy shining pageantry.

  DRAGON

  SOME saw a dragon eating up the light,
  Oho! Oho! Oho, ho, ho!
  Some heard a lost bird riding out the night,
  Oho! Oho! Oho, ho, ho!

  But I saw:
  A low dark hill with its twisted back
  Two wings of flame from the green cloud rack,
  A sprawling flank overlaid with leaf
  Glitter and gleam and shine like steel,
  Crackle and lash like a serpent's tail!

  And I heard:
  The wind draw out of the west and wail,
  Dance and stagger and jig and reel!
  With the long low sound of a life in grief!

  I saw a life in grief
  Oho! Oho! Oho, ho, ho
  Dance and stagger and jig and reel!
  Oho! Oho! Oho, ho, ho!

  GREEN GOLDEN DOOR

  GREEN golden door, swing in, swing in!
  Fanning the life a man must live,
  Echoes and airs and minstrelsies,
  Love and hope that he called his,
  Fear and hurt and a man's own sin
  Casting them forth and sucking them in,
  Green golden door, swing out, swing out!

  Green golden door, swing in, swing in!
  Show me the youth that will not die,
  Tell me the dream that has not waked,
  Seek me the heart that never ached,
  Green golden door, swing out, swing out!

  Green golden door, swing in, swing out!
  Long is the wailing of man's breath,
  Short is the wail of death.

  SLEEPY HOLLOW, CONCORD

  FOUR graves there are upon the wooded crest,
  Each one a shrine to pilgrims ever dear.
  Uncovered, mute, are those who tarry here.
  Romance's dreaming master lies at rest
  Beneath the cedars.  Near is one whose breast
  Held Mother Nature's lore.  Beyond, the seer
  And sage.  There, one who saw her duty clear,
  Her name by little men and women blessed.

  Four friends who walked in Concord's pleasant ways
  Long years ago.  They dwelt and worked apart,
  But now the world has crowned them with its bays,
  And holds them close forever to its heart.
  O, sacred hill!  There Genius, guarding stays,
  And from its slopes shall never Love depart!

  THE SWORD OF ARTHUR

  A CASTLE stands in Yorkshire
  (Oh, the hill is fair and green!)
  And far beneath it lies a cave
  No living man has seen.

  It is the cave enchanted
  (Oh, seek it ere ye die!)
  And there King Arthur and his knights
  In dreamless slumber lie.

  One time a peasant found it
  (Oh, the years have hurried well!)
  It was the day of fate for him,
  And this is what befell:

  Upon a couch of crystal
  (Oh, heart be pure and strong!)
  He saw the King, and, close beside,
  The armored knights athrong.

  And all of them were sleeping
  (Praise God, who sendeth rest!)
  The sleep that comes when strife is done
  And ended every quest.

  Beside the good King Arthur
  (How high is your desire?)
  His sword within its scabbard lay,
  The sword with blade of fire.

  Now had the peasant known it
  (Oh, if we all could know!)

  He should have drawn that wondrous blade
  Before he turned to go.

  If but his hand had touched it
  (The sword still lieth there!)
  He would have felt in every vein
  A lofty purpose thrill.
  If but his hand had drawn it
  (The sword still lieth there!)
  A kingly way he would have walked,
  Wherever he might fare.
  But no; he fled affrighted
  (Oh, pitiful the cost!)
  And then he knew; but lo! the way
  Into the cave was lost.

  He searched forever after
  (All this was long ago!)
  But nevermore that crystal cave
  His eager eyes could know.

  Pray God ye have the vision
  (Oh, search in every land!)
  To seize the sword that Arthur bore
  When it lies at your hand.

  THE DIVINE FOREST

  IF there be leaves on the forest floor,
  Dead leaves there are and nothing more,
  If trunks of trees seem sentinels,
  For what their vigil no man tells.
  And if you clasp these guardian trees
  Nothing there is to hurt or please;
  Only the dead roof of the forest drops
  Gently down and never stops
  And roofs you in and roofs you under,
  Mute and away from life's dim thunder;
  And if there come eternal spring
  It is but more disheartening,
  For Autumn takes the Spring and Summer--
  Autumn that is the latest comer--
  With the Springtime's misty wonder
  And the Summer's yield of gold,
  Weighs you down and weighs you under
  To where the blackened leaves are mold. . .
  The lone gift of the forest is ever new:
  Eternity where dwell not you.
  The forest, accepting, heeds you not;
  Accepting all-you are forgot.
  If there be leaves on the forest floor,
  Dead leaves there are and nothing more.

  Once the forest spoke but now is silent,
  Save in the skyward branches whence no sound
  Seems to touch ear of any man below--
  Or else no longer the man knows how to hear.
  Such men build roofs to keep the forest out,
  Yet all their roofs are built of the forest's self;

  Only they make the dead tree a shield against the
  living.
  Such lapsing of the forest then they use
  And turn it into countless lowly dwellings;
  Sometimes they even cut the living down
  To leaven the dead roofs they would erect.
  Though some of these low roofs are lovely there
  Beneath the guardianship of forest trees,
  And some yearn upward as with thought of wings,
  Yet the eyes of the dwellers therein are dark
  To the upper forest and they
  Fearful of the windy freedom of its top.
  They have forgotten
  That the greatest roof is but a banner
  And that it was a tree that made a Cross.

  MAGIC

  TO W.S.B.

  I RAN into the sunset light
  As hard as I could run:
  The treetops bowed in sheer delight
  As if they loved the sun:
  And all the songs of little birds
  Who laughed and cried in silver words
  Were joined as they were one.

  And down the streaming golden sky
  A lark came circling with a cry
  Of wonder-weaving joy:
  And all the arch of heaven rang
  Where meadowlands of dreaming hang
  As when I was a boy.

  And through the ringing solitude
  In pulsing lovely amplitude
  A mist hung in a shroud,
  As though the light of loneliness
  Turned pure delight to holiness,
  And bathed it in a cloud.

  I stripped my laughing body bare
  And plunged into that holy air
  That washed me like a sea,
  And raced against its silver tide
  That stroked my eager glancing side
  And made my spirit free.


  Across the limits of the land
  The wind and I swept hand and hand
  Beyond the golden glow.
  We danced across the ocean plain
  Like thrushes singing in the rain
  A song of long ago.

  And on into the silver night
  We strove to win the race with light
  And bring the vision home,
  And bring the wonder home again
  Unto the sleeping eyes of men
  Across the singing foam.

  And down the river of the world
  Our glowing, limbs in glory swirled
  As spring within a flower,
  And stars in music of delight
  Streamed gayly down our shoulders white
  Like petals in a shower.

  And tears of awful wonder ran
  Adown my cheeks to hear the clan
  Of beauty chaunting white
  The prayer too deep for living word,
  Or sight of man or winging bird,
  Or music over forest heard
  At falling of the night.

  And dropping slowly as the dew
  On grasses that the winds renew
  In urge of flooding fire,
  And softly as the hushing boughs
  The gentle airs of dawn arouse
  To cradle morning's quire.

  The murmur of the singing leaves
  Around the secret Flame,
  Like mating swallows 'neath the eaves
  In rustling silence came,
  And flowing through the silent air
  Creation fluttered in a prayer
  Descending on a spiral stair,
  And calling me by name.

  It nestled in my dreaming eyes
  Like heaven in a lake,
  And softened hope into surprise
  For very beauty's sake,
  And silence blossomed into morn,
  Whose fragrant rosy-breasted dawn
  Could scarcely bear to break.

  I sang into the morning light
  As loud as I could sing,
  The treetops bowed in sheer delight
  Before the slanting wing.
  And all the songs of little birds
  Who laughed and cried in silver words
  Adored the Risen Spring.

  MICHAEL PAT

  TO ANNA HEMPSTEAD BRANCH

  OLD Michael Pat he said to me
  He saw an angel in a tree.
  He knew I'd never, never doubt him,
  For what would heaven be without them.
  The angel laughed for very glee
  And sang out loud: "Heigh! come with me!"
  Old Michael felt a creeping kind
  Of wonder in his humble mind,
  And, hardly knowing what to say,
  Ran where the angel showed the way.
  The lambs were running on the hills,
  Glad laughter echoed from the rills,
  And many hidden little birds
  Talked pleasant things in singing words.
  He followed up a mountain then
  And saw a crowd of singing men
  Approaching to a Crown of Light
  Wherein they took a fresh delight.
  He danced and sang and whooped and crew
  To see the Lord of all he knew
  Surrounded by the living songs
  Of stars and men in countless throngs,
  And then he died to life again,
  And shovelled with the strength of ten.
  He taught me how to say my letters,
  And take my hat off to my betters,
  And when I asked for fairy stories,
  He told me of angelic glories.
  He was a lovely farmer, he
  Had seen an angel in a tree.

  SONG

  FROM "FLESH: A GEOGORIAN ODE"

  EBB on with me across the sunset tide
  And float beyond the waters of the world,
  The light of evening slipping from my side,
  Thy softened voice in waves of silence furled.

  Flow on into the flaming morning wine,
  Drowning the land in color. Then on high
  Rise in thy candid innocence and shine
  Like to a poplar straight against the sky.

  IN MEMORIAM: FRANCIS LEDWIDGE
  (Killed in action, July 31, 1917)


  SOLDIER and singer of Erin,
  What may I fashion for thee?
  What garland of words or of flowers?
  Singer of sunlight and showers,
  The wind on the lea;

  Of clouds, and the houses of Erin,
  Wee cabins, white on the plain,
  And bright with the colours of even,
  Beauty of earth and of heaven falls
  Outspread beyond Slane!
  night through let my mind be still,

  Slane, where the Easter of Patrick
  Flamed on the night of the Gael,
  Guard both the honor and story
  Of him who has died for the glory
  That crowns Innisfail.

  Soldier of right and of freedom,
  I offer thee song and hot tears.
  With Brian, and Red Hugh O'Donnell,
  The chiefs of Tyrone and Tryconnell,
  Live on through the years!

  NORREYS JEPHSON O'CONOR


  EVENSONG

  A SHEPHERD piping, herald of the Night
  Who comes with Silence up the coloured vale,
  Treading low gently, clad in greyish white,
  Poignantly piping, sound your reedy wail!
  For Day departed moves in funeral train
  Tended by Twilight and, in deepest rose,
  The splendid Sunset melts beneath the main
  While sweet the Sea-wind with cool softness blows.
  As when a mother gathers to her breast
  The child who frets for Dad's remembered smart,
  Now Light fades quickly in the ashen west,
  And Night-Peace falls across my troubled heart.
  Flutes, for the night through let my mind be still,
  And God keep safe with Him my stubborn will!

  NORREYS JEPHSON O'CONOR


  THE PROPHET

  ALL day long he kept the sheep:--
  Far and early, from the crowd,
  On the hills from steep to steep,
  Where the silence cried aloud;
  And the shadow of the cloud
  Wrapt him in a noonday sleep.

  Where he dipped the water's cool,
  Filling boyish hands from thence,
  Something breathed across the pool
  Stir of sweet enlightenments;
  And he drank, with thirsty sense,
  Till his heart was brimmed and full.

  Still, the hovering Voice unshed,
  And the Vision unbeheld,
  And the mute sky overhead,
  And his longing, still withheld!
  --Even when the two tears welled,
  Salt, upon that lonely bread.

  Vaguely blessed in the leaves,
  Dim-companioned in the sun,
  Eager mornings, wistful eyes,
  Very hunger drew him on;
  And To-morrow ever shone
  With the glow the sunset weaves.

  Even so, to that young heart,
  Words and hands and Men were dear;
  And the stir of lane and mart
  After daylong vigil here.
  Sunset called, and he drew near,
  Still to find his path apart.

  When the Bell, with gentle tongue,
  Called the herd-bells home again,
  Through the purple shades he swung,
  Down the mountain, through the glen;
  Towards the sound of fellow-men,--
  Even from the light that clung.

  Dimly too, as cloud on cloud,
  Came that silent flock of his:
  Thronging whiteness, in a crowd,
  After homing twos and threes;
  With the longing memories
  Of all white things dreamed and vowed.

  Through the fragrances, alone,
  By the sudden-silent brook,
  From the open world unknown,
  To the close of speech and book;
  There to find the foreign look
  In the faces of his own.

  Sharing was beyond his skill;
  Shyly yet, he made essay:
  Sought to dip, and share, and fill
  Heart's-desire, from day to day.
  But their eyes, some foreign way,
  Looked at him; and he was still.

  Last, he reached his arms to sleep,
  Where the Vision waited, dim,
  Still beyond some deep-on-deep.

  And the darkness folded him,
  Eager heart and weary limb.--
  All day long, he kept the sheep.

  HARVEST-MOON: 1914

  OVER the twilight field,
  The overflowing field,--
  Over the glimmering field,
  And bleeding furrows with their sodden yield
  Of sheaves that still did writhe,
  After the scythe;
  The teeming field and darkly overstrewn
  With all the garnered fulness of that noon--
  Two looked upon each other.
  One was a Woman men called their mother;
  And one, the Harvest-Moon.

  And one, the Harvest-Moon,
  Who stood, who gazed
  On those unquiet gleanings where they bled;
  Till the lone Woman said:
  "But we were crazed...
  We should laugh now together, I and you,
  We two.
  You, for your dreaming it was worth
  A star's while to look on and light the Earth;
  And I, forever telling to my mind,
  Glory it was, and gladness, to give birth
  To humankind!
  Yes, I, that ever thought it not amiss
  To give the breath to men,
  For men to slay again:
  Lording it over anguish but to give
  My life that men might live
  For this.
  You will be laughing now, remembering
  I called you once Dead World, and barren thing,

  Yes, so we named you then,
  You, far more wise
  Than to give life to men."

  Over the field, that there
  Gave back the skies
  A shattered upward stare
  From blank white eyes,--
  Striving awhile, through many a bleeding dune
  Of throbbing clay, but dumb and quiet soon,
  She looked; and went her way--
  The Harvest-Moon.

  HORSEMAN SPRINGING
  FROM THE DARK: A DREAM

  "HORSEMAN, springing from the dark,
  Horseman, flying wild and free,
  Tell me what shall be thy road
  Whither speedest far from me?"

  "From the dark into the light,
  From the small unto the great,
  From the valleys dark I ride
  O'er the hills to conquer fate!"

  "Take me with thee, horseman mine!
  Let me madly rode with thee!"
  As he turned I met his eyes,
  My own soul looked back at me!

  THREE QUATRAINS

  THE CUP

  SHE said, "Lift high the cup!"
  Of her arm's weariness she gave no sign,
  But, smiling, raised it up
  That none might see or guess it held no wine.


  FORGIVE ME NOT!

  FORGIVE me not! Hate me and I shall know
  Some of Love's fire still burns within your breast!
  Forgiveness finds its home in hearts at rest,
  On dead volcanoes only lies the snow.


  THE ROSE

  ONE deep red rose I dropped into his grave,
  So small a thing to give so great a friend!
  Yet well he knew it was my heart I gave
  And must fare on without it to the end,

  LILLA CABOT PERRY

  A VALENTINE, UNSENT
  STAY, flaming rose, 'twould grieve her heart
  To see you fade away,
  Unloved, unwelcome and apart
  From every joy to-day.

  Once long ago your tale was new,
  Days distant yet so dear;
  Why say her lover still is true,
  When that is all her fear?

  Why thus recall another's pain,
  Her tender heart to fret?
  Best let her think he loves again,
  Who never can forget!

  MARGARET PERRY



  SHIPBUILDERS

  THE German people reared them
  An idol made of wood;
  And Hindenburg before them
  Lifelike and stupid stood.

  To clothe him all in iron
  And thus his soul express,
  With nails and spikes they covered
  His wooden nakedness.

  And when they, thus had clothed him
  All in a suit of mail,
  Still came they, wild-eyed, looking
  For space to drive a nail.
  Whenever Teuton airmen
  Slay boys and girls at play,
  Or U-boats, drowning babies,
  Create a holiday.

  Then, gathering round their statue,
  A happy German throng
  Drive nails into the idol
  To make him still more strong.

  Avenge the babes, shipbuilders,
  That on the seas have died;
  Avenge the little children
  Murdered for Wilhelm's pride.
  Come, gather at the shipyards,
  And let your hammers ring,
  For more than ships and cargoes
  Waits on your fashioning.

  Come, gather at the shipyards;
  With every bolt you drive
  Bethink you `tis the Kaiser
  Whose brutish head you rive.

  Come, gather at the shipyards,
  And swing with might and main;
  `Tis Tirpitz and the Crown Prince
  That you to-day have slain.

  Come, gather at the shipyards,
  And heat the metal hot,
  For it is Bethmann Hollweg
  You're boiling in the pot.

  Come, gather at the shipyards,--
  And when the day is done,
  You've spent it in driving spikes,
  In Hindernburg the Hun.

  Come, gather at the shipyards,
  And toil with healthy hate,
  For only you can save the world,
  The Hun is at the gate.

  UNFADING PICTURES

("The air from the sea came blowing in again,
mixed with the perfume of the flowers....
The old-fashioned furniture brightly rubbed and
polished, my aunt's inviolable chair and table by the
round green fan in the bow-window, the drugget-covered
carpet, the cat, the kettle-holder, the two
canaries, the old china ... and, wonderfully out of
keeping with the rest, my dusty self upon the sofa,
taking note of everything."

  -"David Copperfield," Chapter XIII.)

  HOW many are the scenes he limned,
  With artist strokes, clear-cut and free--
  Our Dickens; time shall not efface
  Their charm, and they will ever grace
  The halls of memory.

  Oft and again we turn to them,
  To contemplate in pleased review;
  And like some picture on the screen
  Comes now to mind a favorite scene
  His master-pencil drew:--

  Upon a sofa, stretched in sleep,
  I see a small lad, spent and worn,
  And by the window, stern and grim,
  A silent figure watching him,
  So dusty, ragged, torn.

  Ah, now she rises from behind
  The round green fan beside her chair;
  "Poor fellow!" croons-and pity lends
  Her voice new softness-and she bends
  And brushes back his hair.

  Then in his sleep he softly stirs.
  Was that a dream, these murmured words?
  He wakes! There by the casement sat
  Miss Trotwood still; close by, her cat
  And her canary birds.

  The peaceful calm of that quaint room,
  Its marks of comfort everywhere--
  Old china and mahogany
  And blowing in, fresh from the sea,
  The perfume-laden air.

  Poor little pilgrim so bereft,
  So weary at his journey's end!
  What joy must then have filled his soul
  To reach at last such happy goal--
  To find--oh, such a friend!...

  And then night came, and from his bed
  He saw the sea, moonlit and bright,
  And dreamed there came, to bless her son,
  His mother, with her little one,
  Adown that path of light.

  Ah, greater blessing I'd not crave,
  When my life's pilgrimage is o'er,
  Than such repose, content, and love;
  Some shining path that leads above
  To dear ones gone before!

  LOUELLA C. POOLE


  WITH WAVES AND WINGS

  WAVES and Wings and Growing Things!
  As through the gladden sight ye flow
  And flit and glow,
  Ye win me so
  In soul to go,
  I too am waves, I too am wings,
  And kindred motion in me springs.

  With thee I pass, glad growing grass!--
  I climb the air with lissome mien;
  Unsheathing keen
  The vivid sheen
  Of springing green,
  I thrill the crude, exalt the crass
  Fine-flex'd and fluent from Earth's mass.

  And impulse craves with thee, Sea Waves!--
  To make all mutable the floor
  Of Earth's firm shore,
  With flashing pour
  Whose brimming o'er
  Impassion'd motion loves and laves
  And livens sombre slumbering caves.

  Then soaring where the wild birds fare,
  My song would sweep the windy lyre
  Of Heaven's choir,
  Pulsing desire
  For starry fire,
  Abashing chilling vagues of air
  With throbbing of warm breasts that dare!

  BLUEBERRIES

  UPON the hills of Garlingtown
  Beneath the summer sky,
  In many pleasant pastures
  On sunny slopes and high,
  Their skins abloom with dusty blue,
  Asleep, the berries lie.

  And all the lads of Garlingtown,
  And all the lasses too,
  Still climb the tranquil hillsides,
  A merry, barefoot crew;
  Still homeward plod with unfilled pails
  And mouths of berry blue.

  And all the birds of Garlingtown,
  When flocking back to nest,
  Remember well the patches
  Where berries are the best;
  They pick the ripest ones at dawn
  And leave the lads the rest.

  Upon the hills of Garlingtown
  When berry-time was o'er,
  I looked into the sunset,
  And saw an open door,
  And from the hills of Garlingtown
  I went, and came no more.

  NOCTURNE

  NIGHT of infinite power and infinite silence and space,
  From you may mortals infer, if ever, the scope divine!
  The jealous sun conceals all but his arrogant face,
  You bid the Milky Way and a million suns to shine.

  Each star to numberless planets gives light and motion and heat,
  But you enmantle them all, the nearest and most remote;
  And the lustres of all the suns are but spangles under your feet,--
  Mere bubbles and beads of noon, they circle and shine and float.

  WILLIAM ROSCOE THAYER


  ENVOI

  I WALKED with poets in my youth,
  Because the world they drew
  Was beautiful and glorious
  Beyond the world I knew.

  The poets are my comrades still,
  But dearer than in youth,
  For now I know that they alone
  Picture the world of truth.

  WILLIAM ROSCOE THAYER


  THERE WHERE THE SEA

  THERE where the sea enwrapt
  A strip of land and wind-swept dune,
  Where nature was quiescent in the glimmering
  Noonday sun of early June,--
  The Placid sea lay shimmering
  In a mist of blue,
  From which the sky now drew
  Its wealth of hue and colour;
  One heard but the deep breathing of the ocean,
  As it breathed along the shore in even motion.
  Among the pines and listless of the scene,
  Atthis and Alcaeus lay,
  Within the heart of each a hunger
  For the unknown gift of life.
  Here from day to day
  They met and dreamed away
  The soft unfloding days of spring,--
  Now turning to the summer.

  Aleaeus:

  I am faint with all the fire
  In my blood,
  And I would plunge into the quiet blue
  And lose all sense of time and you.

  Atthis:

  I, too, would plunge
  And swim with you!

  Doffing her robe, the maid stood in her beauty,
  Calm and sure and unafraid,
  The sinuous splendour of her limbs,
  A silent symphony of curving line,
  Which reached its final note
  In breast and rounded throat.
  He had not known that flesh could be so fair;
  Each movement which she made
  Wove o'er his sense a deeper spell,
  Her beauty swept him like a flame
  And caught him unaware.
  She looked into his eyes, then dropping hers
  Before that burning gaze,
  Softly turned and crept with sunlit shoulders
  Down among the boulders,
  To the sea.
  Secure within its covering depth
  She called to him to follow.
  She led him out along the tide,
  With swift unerring stroke,
  Nor paused till he was at her side.
  With conquering arm
  He seized her and from her brow
  Tossed back the dripping locks, and sought her lips--
  Her eyes closed,--
  As all her body yielded to his kiss.
  Then home he bore her to the shore,
  Within his heart a song of triumph;
  In hers, a new-born joy of womanhood.
  So spring for them passed on to summer.

  MARRIAGE

  YOU, who have given me your name,
  And with your laws have made me wife,
  To share your failures and your fame,
  Whose word has made me yours for life.

  What proof have you that you hold me?
  That in reality I'm one
  With you, through all eternity?
  What proof when all is said and done?

  In spite of all the laws you've made,
  I'm free. I am no part of you.
  But wait-the last word is not said;
  You're mine, for I'm myself and you.

  All through my veins there flows your blood,
  In you there is no part of me.
  By virtue of my motherhood
  Through me you live eternally.

  MARIE TUDOR


  PITY

  Oh do not Pity me because I gave
  My heart when lovely April with a gust,
  Swept down the singing lanes with a cool wave;
  And do not pity me because I thrust
  Aside your love that once burned as a flame.
  I was as thirsty as a windy flower
  That bares its bosom to the summer shower
  And to the unremembered winds that came.
  Pity me most for moments yet to be,
  In the far years, when some day I shall turn
  Toward this strong path up to our little door
  And find it barred to all my ecstasy.
  No sound of your warm voice the winds have borne--
  Only the crying sea upon the shore.

  HAROLD VINAL


  A ROSE TO THE LIVING

  A ROSE to the living is more
  Than sumptuous wreaths to the dead;
  In filling love's infinite store,
  A rose to the living is more,
  If graciously given before
  The hungering spirit is fled,--
  A rose to the living is more
  Than sumptuous wreaths to the dead.

  NIXON WATERMAN


  THE STORM

  SHE reached for sunset fires,
  And lived with stars and the sea,
  The mountains for her temple,
  The storm for priest had she.

  Together a libation
  They poured to the God she knew,
  Such wine as ageless heavens
  And lonely wisdom brew.

  Now she has done with worship,
  For her all rites are the same;
  Yet the storm keeps green forever
  The moss upon her name.

  G. O. WARREN


  WHERE THEY SLEEP

  THE fog inrolling, dark and still
  Lies deep upon the crowded dead
  As flooding sea upon the sands,
  And quenches starlight overhead.

  Long have they slept. Their separate dust
  Has mingled with a nameless mould.
  Only the slower-crumbling stones
  Still tell so much as may be told.

  And now in shoreless fog adrift
  Like some lone mariner gliding by,
  I lean above the drowning graves
  And wonder when I too shall lie

  Where evermore the tides of night
  And earth will hide my lonely rest;
  And Time will bid my love forget
  To read the stone upon my breast.

  G. O. WARREN


  BEAUTY

  NOT flesh alone am I, when I can be
  So swiftly caught in Beauty's shimmering thread
  Whose slender fibres, woven, held by me,
  With their frail strength my following heart have led.

  Yea, not all mortal, not all death my mind,
  When, watching by lone twilight waters' brim
  I tremblingly decipher, as they wind,
  Her deathless hieroglyphs, though strange and dim.

  So for this faith, when Thou my dust shalt bring
  To dust, remember well, Great Alchemist,
  Yearly to change my wintry earth to spring,
  That I with Beauty still may keep my tryst.

  G. O. WARREN


  COMRADES

  WHERE are the friends that I knew in my
  Maying,
  In the days of my youth, in the first of my
  roaming?
  We were dear; we were leal; O, far we went
  straying;
  Now never a heart to my heart comes homing!--
  Where is he now, the dark boy slender
  Who taught me bare-back, stirrup and reins?
  I love him; he loved me; my beautiful, tender
  Tamer of horses on grass-grown plains.

  Where is he now whose eyes swam brighter,
  Softer than love, in his turbulent charms;
  Who taught me to strike, and to fall, dear fighter,
  And gather me up in his boyhood arms;
  Taught me the rifle, and with me went riding,
  Suppled my limbs to the horseman's war;
  Where is he now, for whom my heart's biding,
  Biding, biding--but he rides far!

  O love that passes the love of woman!
  Who that hath felt it shall ever forget
  When the breath of life with a throb turns human,
  And a lad's heart is to a lad's heart set?
  Ever, forever, lover and rover--
  They shall cling, nor each from other shall part
  Till the reign of the stars in the heavens be 'over,
  And life is dust in each faithful heart.

  They are dead, the American grasses under;
  There is no one now who presses my side;
  By the African chotts I am riding asunder,
  And with great joy ride I the last great ride.
  I am fey; I am fein of sudden dying;
  Thousands of miles there is no one near;
  And my heart--all the night it is crying, crying
  In the bosoms of dead lads darling-dear.

  Hearts of my music--them dark earth covers;
  Comrades to die, and to die for, were they;
  In the width of the world there were no such rovers--
  Back to back, breast to breast, it was ours to stay;
  And the highest on earth was the vow that we cherished,
  To spur forth from the crowd and come back never more,
  And to ride in the track of great souls perished
  Till the nests of the lark shall roof us o'er.

  Yet lingers a horseman on Altai highlands,
  Who hath joy of me, riding the Tartar glissade,
  And one, far faring o'er orient islands
  Whose blood yet glints with my blade's accolade;
  North, west, east, I fling you my last hallooing,
  Last love to the breasts where my own has bled;
  Through the reach of the desert my soul leaps pursuing
  My star where it rises a Star of the Dead.

  GEORGE EDWARD WOODBERRY


  THE FLIGHT

  I

  O WILD HEART, track the land's perfume,
  Beach-roses and moor-heather!
  All fragrances of herb and bloom
  Fail, out at sea, together.
  O follow where aloft find room
  Lark-song and eagle-feather!
  All ecstasies of throat and plume
  Melt, high on yon blue weather.

  O leave on sky and ocean lost
  The flight creation dareth;
  Take wings of love, that mounts the most:
  Find fame, that furthest fareth!
  Thy flight, albeit amid her host
  Thee, too, night star-like beareth,
  Flying, thy breast on heaven's coast,
  The infinite outweareth.

  II

  "Dead o'er us roll celestial fires;
  Mute stand Earth's ancient beaches;
  Old thoughts, old instincts, old desires,
  The passing hour outreaches;
  The soul creative never tires--
  Evokes, adores, beseeches;
  And that heart most the god inspires
  Whom most its wildness teaches.

  "For I will course through falling years
  And stars and cities burning;
  And I will march through dying cheers
  Past empires unreturning;
  Ever the world flame reappears
  Where mankind power is earning,
  The nations' hopes, the people's tears,
  One with the wild heart yearning.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

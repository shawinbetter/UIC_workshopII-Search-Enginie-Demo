Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

We need your donations more than ever!

REPERTORY OF THE COMEDIE HUMAINE
PART I, A -- K



TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

"Work crowned by the French Academy" is a significant line borne by
the title-page of the original edition of Messieurs Cerfberr and
Christophe's monumental work. The motto indicates the high esteem in
which the French authorities hold this very necessary adjunct to the
great Balzacian structure. And even without this word of approval, the
intelligent reader needs but a glance within the pages of the
/Repertory of the Comedie Humaine/ to convince him at once of its
utility.

In brief, the purpose of the /Repertory/ is to give in alphabetical
sequence the names of all the characters forming this Balzacian
society, together with the salient points in their lives. It is, of
course, well known that Balzac made his characters appear again and
again, thus creating out of his distinct novels a miniature world. To
cite a case in point, Rastignac, who comes as near being the hero of
the /Comedie/ as any other single character, makes his first
appearance in /Father Goriot/, as a student of law; then appearing and
disappearing fitfully in a score of principal novels, he is finally
made a minister and peer of France. Without the aid of the /Repertory/
it would be difficult for any save a reader of the entire /Comedie/ to
trace out his career. But here it is arranged in temporal sequence,
thus giving us a concrete view of the man and his relation to this
society.

In reading any separate story, when reference is made in passing to a
character, the reader will find it helpful and interesting to turn to
the /Repertory/ and find what manner of man it is that is under
advisement. A little systematic reading of this nature will speedily
render the reader a "confirmed Balzacian."

A slight confusion may arise in the use of the /Repertory/ on account
of the subdivision of titles. This is the fault neither of Messieurs
Cerfberr and Christophe nor of the translator, but of Balzac himself,
who was continually changing titles, dividing and subdividing stories,
and revamping and working other changes in his books. /Cousin Betty/
and /Cousin Pons/ were placed together by him under the general title
of /Poor Relations/. Being separate stories, we have retained the
separate titles. Similarly, the three divisions of /Lost Illusions/
were never published together until 1843--in the first complete
edition of the /Comedie/; before assuming final shape its parts had
received several different titles. In the present text the editor has
deemed it best to retain two of the parts under /Lost Illusions/,
while the third, which presents a separate Rubempre episode, is given
as /A Distinguished Provincial at Paris/. The three parts of /The
Thirteen/--/Ferragus/, /The Duchess of Langeais/, and /The Girl with
the Golden Eyes/--are given under the general title. The fourth part
of /Scenes from a Courtesan's Life/, /Vautrin's Last Avatar/, which
until the Edition Definitive had been published separately, is here
merged into its final place. But the three parts of /The Celibates/--
/Pierrette/, /The Vicar of Tours/ and /A Bachelor's Establishment/,
being detached, are given separately. Other minor instances occur, but
should be readily cleared up by reference to the Indices, also to the
General Introduction given elsewhere.

In the preparation of this English text, great care has been exercised
to gain accuracy--a quality not found in other versions now extant. In
one or two instances, errors have been discovered in the original
French, notably in dates--probably typographical errors--which have
been corrected by means of foot-notes. A few unimportant elisions have
been made for the sake of brevity and coherence. Many difficulties
confront the translator in the preparation of material of this nature,
involving names, dates and titles. Opportunities are constantly
afforded for error, and the work must necessarily be painstaking in
order to be successful. We desire here to express appreciation for the
valuable assistance of Mr. Norman Hinsdale Pitman.

To Balzac, more than to any other author, a Repertory of characters is
applicable; for he it was who not only created an entire human
society, but placed therein a multitude of personages so real, so
distinct with vitality, that biographies of them seem no more than
simple justice. We can do no more, then, than follow the advice of
Balzac--to quote again from the original title-page--and "give a
parallel to the civil register."

J. WALKER McSPADDEN



INTRODUCTION

Are you a confirmed /Balzacian/?--to employ a former expression of
Gautier in /Jeune France/ on the morrow following the appearance of
that mystic Rabelaisian epic, /The Magic Skin/. Have you experienced,
while reading at school or clandestinely some stray volume of the
/Comedie Humaine/, a sort of exaltation such as no other book had
aroused hitherto, and few have caused since? Have you dreamed at an
age when one plucks in advance all the fruit from the tree of life--
yet in blossom--I repeat, have you dreamed of being a Daniel d'Arthez,
and of covering yourself with glory by the force of your achievements,
in order to be requited, some day, for all the sufferings of your
poverty-stricken youth, by the sublime Diane, Duchesse de
Maufrigneuse, Princesse de Cadignan?

Or, perchance, being more ambitious and less literary, you have
desired to see--like a second Rastignac, the doors of high society
opened to your eager gaze by means of the golden key suspended from
Delphine de Nucingen's bracelet?

Romancist, have you sighed for the angelic tenderness of a Henriette
de Mortsauf, and realized in your dreams the innocent emotions excited
by culling nosegays, by listening to tales of grief, by furtive hand-
clasps on the banks of a narrow river, blue and placid, in a valley
where your friendship flourishes like a fair, delicate lily, the
ideal, the chaste flower?

Misanthrope, have you caressed the chimera, to ward off the dark hours
of advancing age, of a friendship equal to that with which the good
Schmucke enveloped even the whims of his poor Pons? Have you
appreciated the sovereign power of secret societies, and deliberated
with yourself as to which of your acquaintances would be most worthy
to enter The Thirteen? In your mind's eye has the map of France ever
appeared to be divided into as many provinces as the /Comedie Humaine/
has stories? Has Tours stood for Birotteau, La Gamard, for the
formidable Abbe Troubert; Douai, Claes; Limoges, Madame Graslin;
Besancon, Savarus and his misguided love; Angouleme, Rubempre;
Sancerre, Madame de la Baudraye; Alencon, that touching, artless old
maid to whom her uncle, the Abbe de Sponde, remarked with gentle
irony: "You have too much wit. You don't need so much to be happy"?

Oh, sorcery of the most wonderful magician of letters the world has
seen since Shakespeare! If you have come under the spell of his
enchantments, be it only for an hour, here is a book that will delight
you, a book that would have pleased Balzac himself--Balzac, who was
more the victim of his work than his most fanatical readers, and whose
dream was to compete with the civil records. This volume of nearly six
hundred pages is really the civil record of all the characters in the
/Comedie Humaine/, by which you may locate, detail by detail, the
smallest adventures of the heroes who pass and repass through the
various novels, and by which you can recall at a moment's notice the
emotions once awakened by the perusal of such and such a masterpiece.
More modestly, it is a kind of table of contents, of a unique type; a
table of living contents!

Many Balzacians have dreamed of compiling such a civil record. I
myself have known of five or six who attempted this singular task. To
cite only two names out of the many, the idea of this unusual Vapereau
ran through the head of that keen and delicate critic, M. Henri
Meilhac, and of that detective in continued stories, Emile Gaboriau. I
believe that I also have among the papers of my eighteenth year some
sheets covered with notes taken with the same intention. But the labor
was too exhaustive. It demanded an infinite patience, combined with an
inextinguishable ardor and enthusiasm. The two faithful disciples of
the master who have conjoined their efforts to uprear this monument,
could not perhaps have overcome the difficulties of the undertaking if
they had not supported each other, bringing to the common work, M.
Christophe his painstaking method, M. Cerfberr his accurate memory,
his passionate faith in the genius of the great Honore, a faith that
carried unshakingly whole mountains of documents.

A pleasing chapter of literary gossip might be written about this
collaboration; a melancholy chapter, since it brings with it the
memory of a charming man, who first brought Messieurs Cerfberr and
Christophe together, and who has since died under mournful
circumstances. His name was Albert Allenet, and he was chief editor of
a courageous little review, /La Jeune France/, which he maintained for
some years with a perseverance worthy of the Man of Business in the
/Comedie Humaine/. I can see him yet, a feverish fellow, wan and
haggard, but with his face always lit up by enthusiasm, stopping me in
a theatre lobby to tell me about a plan of M. Cerfberr's; and almost
immediately we discovered that the same plan had been conceived by M.
Christophe. The latter had already prepared a cabinet of pigeon-holes,
arranged and classified by the names of Balzacian characters. When two
men encounter in the same enterprise as compilers, they will either
hate each other or unite their efforts. Thanks to the excellent
Allenet, the two confirmed Balzacians took to each other wonderfully.

Poor Allenet! It was not long afterwards that we accompanied his body
to the grave, one gloomy afternoon towards the end of autumn--all of
us who had known and loved him. He is dead also, that other Balzacian
who was so much interested in this work, and for whom the /Comedie
Humaine/ was an absorbing thought, Honore Granoux. He was a merchant
of Marseilles, with a wan aspect and already an invalid when I met
him. But he became animated when speaking of Balzac; and with what a
mysterious, conspiratorlike veneration did he pronounce these words:
"The Vicomte"--meaning, of course, to the thirty-third degree
Balzacolatrites, that incomparable bibliophile to whom we owe the
history of the novelist's works, M. de Spoelberch de Lovenjoul!--"The
Vicomte will approve--or disapprove." That was the unvarying formula
for Granoux, who had devoted himself to the enormous task of
collecting all the articles, small or great, published about Balzac
since his entry as a writer. And just see what a fascination this
/devil of a man/--as Theophile Gautier once called him--exercises over
his followers; I am fully convinced that these little details of
Balzacian mania will cause the reader to smile. As for me, I have
found them, and still find them, as natural as Balzac's own remark to
Jules Sandeau, who was telling him about a sick sister: "Let us go
back to reality. Who is going to marry Eugenie Grandet?"

Fascination! That is the only word that quite characterizes the sort
of influence wielded by Balzac over those who really enjoy him; and it
is not to-day that the phenomenon began. Vallies pointed it out long
ago in an eloquent page of the /Refractaires/ concerning "book
victims." Saint Beuve, who can scarcely be suspected of fondness
towards the editor-in-chief of the /Revue Parisienne/, tells a story
stranger and more significant than every other. At one time an entire
social set in Venice, and the most aristocratic, decided to give out
among its members different characters drawn from the /Comedie
Humaine/; and some of these roles, the critic adds, mysteriously, were
artistically carried out to the very end;--a dangerous experiment, for
we are well aware that the heroes and heroines of Balzac often skirt
the most treacherous abysses of the social Hell.

All this happened about 1840. The present year is 1887, and there
seems no prospect of the sorcery weakening. The work to which these
notes serve as an introduction may be taken as proof. Indeed, somebody
has said that the men of Balzac have appeared as much in literature as
in life, especially since the death of the novelist. Balzac seems to
have observed the society of his day less than he contributed to form
a new one. Such and such personages are truer to life in 1860 than in
1835. When one considers a phenomenon of such range and intensity, it
does not suffice to employ words like infatuation, fashion, mania. The
attraction of an author becomes a psychological fact of prime
importance and subject to analysis. I think I can see two reasons for
this particular strength of Balzac's genius. One dwells in the special
character of his vision, the other in the philosophical trend which he
succeeded in giving to all his writing.

As to the scope of his vision, this /Repertory/ alone will suffice to
show. Turn over the leaves at random and estimate the number of
fictitious deeds going to make up these two thousand biographies, each
individual, each distinct, and most of them complete--that is to say,
taking the character at his birth and leaving him only at his death.
Balzac not only knows the date of birth or of death, he knows as well
the local coloring of the time and the country and profession to which
the man belongs. He is thoroughly conversant with questions of
taxation and income and the agricultural conditions. He is not
ignorant of the fact that Grandet cannot make his fortune by the same
methods employed by Gobseck, his rival in avarice; nor Ferdinand du
Tillet, that jackal, with the same magnitude of operations worked out
by that elephant of a Nucingen. He has outlined and measured the exact
relation of each character to his environment in the same way he has
outlined and measured the bonds uniting the various characters; so
well that each individual is defined separately as to his personal and
his social side, and in the same manner each family is defined. It is
the skeleton of these individuals and of these families that is laid
bare for your contemplation in these notes of Messieurs Cerfberr and
Christophe. But this structure of facts, dependent one upon another by
a logic equal to that of life itself, is the smallest effort of
Balzac's genius. Does a birth-certificate, a marriage-contract or an
inventory of wealth represent a person? Certainly not. There is still
lacking, for a bone covering, the flesh, the blood, the muscles and
the nerves. A glance from Balzac, and all these tabulated facts become
imbued with life; to this circumstantial view of the conditions of
existence with certain beings is added as full a view of the beings
themselves.

And first of all he knows them physiologically. The inner workings of
their corporeal mechanism is no mystery for him. Whether it is
Birotteau's gout, or Mortsauf's nervousness, or Fraisier's skin
trouble, or the secret reason for Rouget's subjugation by Flore, or
Louis Lambert's catalepsy, he is as conversant with the case as though
he were a physician; and he is as well informed, also, as a confessor
concerning the spiritual mechanism which this animal machine supports.
The slightest frailties of conscience are perceptible to him. From the
portress Cibot to the Marquise d'Espard, not one of his women has an
evil thought that he does not fathom. With what art, comparable to
that of Stendhal, or Laclos, or the most subtle analysts, does he note
--in /The Secrets of a Princess/--the transition from comedy to
sincerity! He knows when a sentiment is simple and when it is complex,
when the heart is a dupe of the mind and when of the senses. And
through it all he hears his characters speak, he distinguishes their
voices, and we ourselves distinguish them in the dialogue. The
growling of Vautrin, the hissing of La Gamard, the melodious tones of
Madame de Mortsauf still linger in our ears. For such intensity of
evocation is as contagious as an enthusiasm or a panic.

There is abundant testimony going to show that with Balzac this
evocation is accomplished, as in the mystic arts by releasing it, so
to speak, from the ordinary laws of life. Pray note in what terms M.
le Docteur Fournier, the real mayor of Tours, relates incidents of the
novelist's method of work, according to the report of a servant
employed at the chateau of Sache: "Sometimes he would shut himself up
in his room and stay there several days. Then it was that, plunged
into a sort of ecstasy and armed with a crow quill, he would write
night and day, abstaining from all food and merely contenting himself
with decoctions of coffee which he himself prepared." [Brochure of M.
le Docteur Fournier in regard to the statue of Balzac, that statue a
piece of work to which M. Henry Renault--another devotee who had
established /Le Balzac/--had given himself so ardently. In this
brochure is found a very curious portrait of Balzac, after a sepia by
Louis Boulanger belonging to M. le Baron Larrey.]

In the opening pages of /Facino Cane/ this phenomenon is thus
described: "With me observation had become intuitive from early youth.
It penetrated the soul without neglecting the body, or rather it
seized so completely the external details that it went beyond them. It
gave me the faculty of living the life of the individual over whom it
obtained control, and allowed me to substitute myself for him like the
dervish in /Arabian Nights/ assumed the soul and the body of persons
over whom he pronounced certain words." And he adds, after describing
how he followed a workman and his wife along the street: "I could
espouse their very life, I felt their rags on my back. I trod in their
tattered shoes. Their desires, their needs, all passed into my soul,
or my soul passed into them. It was the dream of a man awakened." One
day while he and a friend of his were watching a beggar pass by, the
friend was so astonished to see Balzac touch his own sleeve; he seemed
to feel the rent which gaped at the elbow of the beggar.

Am I wrong in connecting this sort of imagination with that which one
witnesses in fanatics of religious faith? With such a faculty Balzac
could not be, like Edgar Poe, merely a narrator of nightmares. He was
preserved from the fantastic by another gift which seems contradictory
to the first. This visionary was in reality a philosopher, that is to
say, an experimenter and a manipulator of general ideas. Proof of this
may be found in his biography, which shows him to us, during his
college days at Vendome, plunged into a whirl of abstract reading. The
entire theological and occult library which he discovered in the old
Oratorian institution was absorbed by the child, till he had to quit
school sick, his brain benumbed by this strange opium. The story of
Louis Lambert is a monograph of his own mind. During his youth and in
the moments snatched from his profession, to what did he turn his
attention? Still to general ideas. We find him an interested onlooker
at the quarrel of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Cuvier, troubling himself
about the hypothesis of the unity of creation, and still dealing with
mysticism; and, in fact, his romances abound in theories. There is not
one of his works from which you cannot obtain abstract thoughts by the
hundreds. If he describes, as in /The Vicar of Tours/, the woes of an
old priest, he profits by the opportunity to exploit a theory
concerning the development of sensibility, and a treatise on the
future of Catholicism. If he describes, as in /The Firm of Nucingen/,
a supper given to Parisian /blases/, he introduces a system of credit,
reports of the Bank and Bureau of Finance, and--any number of other
things! Speaking of Daniel d'Arthez, that one of his heroes who, with
Albert Savarus and Raphael, most nearly resembles himself, he writes:
"Daniel would not admit the existence of talent without profound
metaphysical knowledge. At this moment he was in the act of despoiling
both ancient and modern philosophy of all their wealth in order to
assimilate it. He desired, like Moliere, to become a profound
philosopher first of all, a writer of comedies afterwards." Some
readers there are, indeed, who think that philosophy superabounds with
Balzac, that the surplus of general hypotheses overflows at times, and
that the novels are too prone to digressions. Be that as it may, it
seems incontestible that this was his master faculty, the virtue and
vice of his thought. Let us see, however, by what singular detour this
power of generalization--the antithesis, one might say, of the
creative power--increased in him the faculty of the poetic visionary.

It is important, first of all, to note that this power of the
visionary could not be put directly into play. Balzac had not long
enough to live. The list of his works, year by year, prepared by his
sister, shows that from the moment he achieved his reputation till the
day of his death he never took time for rest or observation or the
study of mankind by daily and close contact, like Moliere or Saint-
Simon. He cut his life in two, writing by night, sleeping by day, and
after sparing not a single hour for calling, promenades or sentiment.
Indeed, he would not admit this troublesome factor of sentiment,
except at a distance and through letters--"because it forms one's
style"! At any rate, that is the kind of love he most willingly
admitted--unless an exception be made of the mysterious intimacies of
which his correspondence has left traces. During his youth he had
followed this same habit of heavy labor, and as a result the
experience of this master of exact literature was reduced to a
minimum; but this minimum sufficed for him, precisely because of the
philosophical insight which he possessed to so high a degree. To this
meagre number of positive faculties furnished by observation, he
applied an analysis so intuitive that he discovered, behind the small
facts amassed by him in no unusual quantity, the profound forces, the
generative influences, so to speak.

He himself describes--once more in connection with Daniel d'Arthez--
the method pursued in this analytical and generalizing work. He calls
it a "retrospective penetration." Probably he lays hold of the
elements of experience and casts them into a seeming retort of
reveries. Thanks to an alchemy somewhat analogous to that of Cuvier,
he was enabled to reconstruct an entire temperament from the smallest
detail, and an entire class from a single individual; but that which
guided him in his work of reconstruction was always and everywhere the
habitual process of philosophers: the quest and investigation of
causes.

It is due to this analysis that this dreamer has defined almost all
the great principles of the psychological changes incident to our
time. He saw clearly, while democracy was establishing itself with us
on the ruins of the ancient regime, the novelty of the sentiments
which these transfers from class to class were certain to produce. He
fathomed every complication of heart and mind in the modern woman by
an intuition of the laws which control her development. He divined the
transformation in the lives of artists, keeping pace with the change
in the national situation; and to this day the picture he has drawn of
journalism in /Lost Illusions/ ("A Distinguished Provincial at Paris")
remains strictly true. It seems to me that this same power of locating
causes, which has brought about such a wealth of ideas in his work,
has also brought about the magic of it all. While other novelists
describe humanity from the outside, he has shown man to us both from
within and without. The characters which crowd forth from his brain
are sustained and impelled by the same social waves which sustain and
impel us. The generative facts which created them are the same which
are always in operation about us. If many young men have taken as a
model a Rastignac, for instance, it is because the passions by which
this ambitious pauper was consumed are the same which our age of
unbridled greed multiplies around disinherited youth. Add to this that
Balzac was not content merely to display the fruitful sources of a
modern intellect, but that he cast upon them the glare of the most
ardent imagination the world has ever known. By a rare combination
this philosopher was also a man, like the story-tellers of the Orient,
to whom solitude and the over-excitement of night-work had
communicated a brilliant and unbroken hallucination. He was able to
impart this fever to his readers, and to plunge them into a sort of
/Arabian Nights/ country, where all the passions, all the desires of
real life appear, but expanded to the point of fantasy, like the
dreams brought on by laudanum or hasheesh. Why, then, should we not
understand the reason that, for certain readers, this world of
Balzac's is more real than the actual world, and that they devoted
their energies to imitating it?

It is possible that to-day the phenomenon is becoming rarer, and that
Balzac, while no less admired, does not exercise the same fascinating
influence. The cause for this is that the great social forces which he
defined have almost ended their work. Other forces now shape the
oncoming generations and prepare them for further sensitive
influences. It is none the less a fact that, to penetrate the central
portions of the nineteenth century in France, one must read and reread
the /Comedie Humaine/. And we owe sincere thanks to Messieurs Cerfberr
and Christophe for this /Repertory/. Thanks to them, we shall the more
easily traverse the long galleries, painted and frescoed, of this
enormous palace,--a palace still unfinished, inasmuch as it lacks
those Scenes of Military Life whose titles awaken dreams within us:
/Forced Marches/; /The Battle of Austerlitz/; /After Dresden/.
Incontestably, Tolstoy's /War and Peace/ is an admirable book, but how
can we help regretting the loss of the painting of the Grand Army and
of our Great Emperor, by Balzac, our Napoleon of letters?

REPERTORY OF THE COMEDIE HUMAINE



A

ABRAMKO, Polish Jew of gigantic strength, thoroughly devoted to the
broker, Elie Magus, whose porter he was, and whose daughter and
treasures he guarded with the aid of three fierce dogs, in 1844, in a
old house on the Minimes road hard by the Palais Royale, Paris.
Abramko had allowed himself to be compromised in the Polish
insurrection and Magus was interested in saving him. [Cousin Pons.]

ADELE, sturdy, good-hearted Briarde servant of Denis Rogron and his
sister, Sylvie, from 1824 to 1827 at Provins. Contrary to her
employers, she displayed much sympathy and pity for their youthful
cousin, Pierrette Lorrain. [Pierrette.]

ADELE, chambermaid of Madame du Val-Noble at the time when the latter
was maintained so magnificently by the stockbroker, Jacques Falleix,
who failed in 1929. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

ADOLPHE, slight, blonde young man employed at the shop of the shawl
merchant, Fritot, in the Bourse quarter, Paris, at the time of the
reign of Louis Philippe. [Gaudissart II.]

ADOLPHUS, head of the banking firm of Adolphus & Company of Manheim,
and father of the Baroness Wilhelmine d'Aldrigger. [The Firm of
Nucingen.]

AGATHE (Sister), nee Langeais, nun of the convent of Chelles, and,
with her sister Martha and the Abbe de Marolles, a refugee under the
Terror in a poor house of the Faubourg Saint-Martin, Paris. [An
Episode Under the Terror.]

AIGLEMONT (General, Marquis Victor d'), heir of the Marquis
d'Aiglemont and nephew of the dowager Comtesse de Listomere-Landon;
born in 1783. After having been the lover of the Marechale de
Carigliano, he married, in the latter part of 1813 (at which time he
was one of the youngest and most dashing colonels of the French
cavalry), Mlle. Julie de Chatillonest, his cousin, with whom he
resided successively at Touraine, Paris and Versailles.* He took part
in the great struggle of the Empire; but the Restoration freed him
from his oath to Napoleon, restored his titles, entrusted to him a
station in the Body Guard, which gave him the rank of general, and
later made him a peer of France. Gradually he forsook his wife, whom
he deceived on account of Madame de Serizy. In 1817 the Marquis
d'Aiglemont became the father of a daughter (See Helene d'Aiglemont)
who was his image physically and morally; his last three children came
into the world during a /liaison/ between the Marquise d'Aiglemont and
the brilliant diplomat, Charles de Vandenesse. In 1827 the general, as
well as his protege and cousin, Godefroid de Beaudenord, was hurt by
the fraudulent failure of the Baron de Nucingen. Moreover, he sank a
million in the Wortschin mines where he had been speculating with
hypothecated securities of his wife's. This completed his ruin. He
went to America, whence he returned, six years later, with a new
fortune. The Marquis d'Aiglemont died, overcome by his exertions, in
1833.** [At the Sign of the Cat and Racket. The Firm of Nucingen. A
Woman of Thirty.]

*   It appears that the residence of the Marquis d'Aiglemont at
    Versailles was located at number 57, on the present Avenue de
    Paris; until recently it was occupied by one of the authors of
    this work.

**  Given erroneously in the original as 1835.

AIGLEMONT (Generale, Marquise Julie d'), wife of the preceding; born
in 1792. Her father, M. de Chatillonest, advised her against, but gave
her in marriage to her cousin, the attractive Colonel Victor
d'Aiglemont, in 1813. Quickly disillusioned and attacked from another
source by an "inflammation very often fatal, and which is spoken of by
women only in confidence," she sank into a profound melancholy. The
death of the Comtesse de Listomere-Landon, her aunt by marriage,
deprived her of valuable protection and advice. Shortly thereafter she
became a mother and found, in the realization of her new duties,
strength to resist the mutual attachment between herself and the young
and romantic Englishman, Lord Arthur Ormond Grenville, a student of
medicine who had nursed her and healed her bodily ailments, and who
died rather than compromise her. Heart-broken, the marquise withdrew
to the solitude of an old chateau situated between Moret and Montereau
in the midst of a neglected waste. She remained a recluse for almost a
year, given over utterly to her grief, refusing the consolations of
the Church offered her by the old cure of the village of Saint-Lange.
Then she re-entered society at Paris. There, at the age of about
thirty, she yielded to the genuine passion of the Marquis de
Vandenesse. A child, christened Charles, was born of this union, but
he perished at an early age under very tragic circumstances. Two other
children, Moina and Abel, were also the result of this love union.
They were favored by their mother above the two eldest children,
Helene and Gustave, the only ones really belonging to the Marquis
d'Aiglemont. Madame d'Aiglemont, when nearly fifty, a widow, and
having none of her children remaining alive save her daughter Moina,
sacrificed all her own fortune for a dower in order to marry the
latter to M. de Saint-Hereen, heir of one of the most famous families
of France. She then went to live with her son-in-law in a magnificent
mansion overlooking the Esplanade des Invalides. But her daughter gave
her slight return for her love. Ruffled one day by some remarks made
to her by Madame d'Aiglemont concerning the suspicious devotion of the
Marquis de Vandenesse, Moina went so far as to fling back at her
mother the remembrance of the latter's own guilty relations with the
young man's father. Terribly overcome by this attack, the poor woman,
who was a physical wreck, deaf and subject to heart disease, died in
1844. [A Woman of Thirty.]

AIGLEMONT (Helene d'), eldest daughter of the Marquis and Marquise
Victor d'Aiglemont; born in 1817. She and her brother Gustave were
neglected by her mother for Charles, Abel and Moina. On this account
Helene became jealous and defiant. When about eight years old, in a
paroxysm of ferocious hate, she pushed her brother Charles into the
Bievre, where he was drowned. This childish crime always passed for a
terrible accident. When a young woman--one Christmas night--Helene
eloped with a mysterious adventurer who was being tracked by justice
and who was, for the time being, in hiding at the home of the Marquis
Victor d'Aiglemont, at Versailles. Her despairing father sought her
vainly. He saw her no more till seven years later, and then only once,
when on his return from America to France. The ship on which he
returned was captured by pirates, whose captain, "The Parisian," the
veritable abductor of Helene, protected the marquis and his fortune.
The two lovers had four beautiful children and lived together in the
most perfect happiness, sharing the same perils. Helene refused to
follow her father. In 1835, some months after the death of her
husband, Madame d'Aiglemont, while taking the youthful Moina to a
Pyrenees watering-place, was asked to aid a poor sufferer. It was her
daughter, Helene, who had just escaped shipwreck, saving only one
child. Both presently succumbed before the eyes of Madame d'Aiglemont.
[A Woman of Thirty.]

AIGLEMONT (Gustave d'), second child of the Marquis and Marquise
Victor d'Aiglemont, and born under the Restoration. His first
appearance is while still a child, about 1827 or 1828, when returning
in company with his father and his sister Helene from the presentation
of a gloomy melodrama at the Gaite theatre. He was obliged to flee
hastily from a scene, which violently agitated Helene, because it
recalled the circumstances surrounding the death of his brother, some
two or three years earlier. Gustave d'Aiglemont is next found in the
drawing-room at Versailles, where the family is assembled, on the same
evening of the abduction of Helene. He died at an early age of
cholera, leaving a widow and children for whom the Dowager Marquise
d'Aiglemont showed little love. [A Woman of Thirty.]

AIGLEMONT (Charles d'), third child of the Marquis and the Marquise
d'Aiglemont, born at the time of the intimacy of Madame d'Aiglemont
with the Marquis de Vandenesse. He appears but a single time, one
spring morning about 1824 or 1825, then being four years old. He was
out walking with his sister Helene, his mother and the Marquis de
Vandenesse. In a sudden outburst of jealous hate, Helene pushed the
little Charles into the Bievre, where he was drowned. [A Woman of
Thirty.]

AIGLEMONT (Moina d'), fourth child and second daughter of the Marquis
and Marquise Victor d'Aiglemont. (See Comtesse de Saint-Hereen.) [A
Woman of Thirty.]

AIGLEMONT (Abel d'), fifth and last child of the Marquis and Marquise
Victor d'Aiglemont, born during the relations of his mother with M. de
Vandenesse. Moina and he were the favorites of Madame d'Aiglemont.
Killed in Africa before Constantine. [A Woman of Thirty.]

AJUDA-PINTO (Marquis Miguel d'), Portuguese belonging to a very old
and wealthy family, the oldest branch of which was connected with the
Bragance and the Grandlieu houses. In 1819 he was enrolled among the
most distinguished dandies who graced Parisian society. At this same
period he began to forsake Claire de Bourgogne, Vicomtesse de
Beauseant, with whom he had been intimate for three years. After
having caused her much uneasiness concerning his real intentions, he
returned her letters, on the intervention of Eugene de Rastignac, and
married Mlle. Berthe de Rochefide. [Father Goriot. Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.] In 1832 he was present at one of Madame d'Espard's
receptions, where every one there joined in slandering the Princesse
de Cadignan before Daniel d'Arthez, then violently enamored of her.
[The Secrets of a Princess.] Towards 1840, the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto,
then a widower, married again--this time Mlle. Josephine de Grandlieu,
third daughter of the last duke of this name. Shortly thereafter, the
marquis was accomplice in a plot hatched by the friends of the
Duchesse de Grandlieu and Madame du Guenic to rescue Calyste du Guenic
from the clutches of the Marquise de Rochefide. [Beatrix.]

AJUDA-PINTO (Marquise Berthe d'), nee Rochefide. Married to the
Marquis Miguel d'Ajuda-Pinto in 1820. Died about 1849. [Beatrix.]

AJUDA-PINTO (Marquise Josephine d'), daughter of the Duc and Duchesse
Ferdinand de Grandlieu; second wife of the Marquis Miguel d'Ajuda-
Pinto, her kinsman by marriage. Their marriage was celebrated about
1840. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

ALAIN (Frederic), born about 1767. He was clerk in the office of
Bordin, procureur of Chatelet. In 1798 he lent one hundred crowns in
gold to Monegod his life-long friend. This sum not being repaid, M.
Alain found himself almost insolvent, and was obliged to take an
insignificant position at the Mont-de-Piete. In addition to this he
kept the books of Cesar Birotteau, the well-known perfumer. Monegod
became wealthy in 1816, and he forced M. Alain to accept a hundred and
fifty thousand francs in payment of the loan of the hundred crowns.
The good man then devoted his unlooked-for fortune to philanthropies
in concert with Judge Popinot. Later, at the close of 1825, he became
one of the most active aides of Madame de la Chanterie and her
charitable association. It was M. Alain who introduced Godefroid into
the Brotherhood of the Consolation. [The Seamy Side of History.]

ALBERTINE, Madame de Bargeton's chambermaid, between the years 1821
and 1824. [Lost Illusions.]

ALBON (Marquis d'), court councillor and ministerial deputy under the
Restoration. Born in 1777. In September, 1819, he went hunting in the
edge of the forest of l'Isle-Adam with his friend Philippe de Sucy,
who suddenly fell senseless at the sight of a poor madwoman whom he
recognized as a former mistress, Stephanie de Vandieres. The Marquis
d'Albon, assisted by two passers by, M. and Mme. de Granville,
resuscitated M. de Sucy. Then the marquis returned, at his friend's
entreaty, to the home of Stephanie, where he learned from the uncle of
this unfortunate one the sad story of the love of his friend and
Madame de Vandieres. [Farewell.]

ALBRIZZI (Comtesse), a friend, in 1820, at Venice, of the celebrated
melomaniac, Capraja. [Massimilla Doni.]

ALDRIGGER (Jean-Baptiste, Baron d'), born in Alsace in 1764. In 1800 a
banker at Strasbourg, where he was at the apogee of a fortune made
during the Revolution, he wedded, partly through ambition, partly
through inclination, the heiress of the Adolphuses of Manheim. The
young daughter was idolized by every one in her family and naturally
inherited all their fortune after some ten years. Aldrigger, created
baron by the Emperor, was passionately devoted to the great man who
had bestowed upon him his title, and he ruined himself, between 1814
and 1815, by believing too deeply in "the sun of Austerlitz." At the
time of the invasion, the trustworthy Alsatian continued to pay on
demand and closed up his bank, thus meriting the remark of Nucingen,
his former head-clerk: "Honest, but stoobid." The Baron d'Aldrigger
went at once to Paris. There still remained to him an income of forty-
four thousand francs, reduced at his death, in 1823, by more than half
on account of the expenditures and carelessness of his wife. The
latter was left a widow with two daughters, Malvina and Isaure. [The
Firm of Nucingen.]

ALDRIGGER (Theodora-Marguerite-Wilhelmine, Baronne d'), nee Adolphus.
Daughter of the banker Adolphus of Manheim, greatly spoiled by her
parents. In 1800 she married the Strasbourg banker, Aldrigger, who
spoiled her as badly as they had done and as later did the two
daughters whom she had by her husband. She was superficial, incapable,
egotistic, coquettish and pretty. At forty years of age she still
preserved almost all her freshness and could be called "the little
Shepherdess of the Alps." In 1823, when the baron died, she came near
following him through her violent grief. The following morning at
breakfast she was served with small pease, of which she was very fond,
and these small pease averted the crisis. She resided in the rue
Joubert, Paris, where she held receptions until the marriage of her
younger daughter. [The Firm of Nucingen.]

ALDRIGGER (Malvina d'), elder daughter of the Baron and Baroness
d'Aldrigger, born at Strasbourg in 1801, at the time when the family
was most wealthy. Dignified, slender, swarthy, sensuous, she was a
good type of the woman "you have seen at Barcelona." Intelligent,
haughty, whole-souled, sentimental and sympathetic, she was
nevertheless smitten by the dry Ferdinand du Tillet, who sought her
hand in marriage at one time, but forsook her when he learned of the
bankruptcy of the Aldrigger family. The lawyer Desroches also
considered asking the hand of Malvina, but he too gave up the idea.
The young girl was counseled by Eugene de Rastignac, who took it upon
himself to see that she got married. Nevertheless, she ended by being
an old maid, withering day by day, giving piano lessons, living rather
meagrely with her mother in a modest flat on the third floor, in the
rue du Mont-Thabor. [The Firm of Nucingen.]

ALDRIGGER (Isaure d'), second daughter of the Baron and Baronne
d'Aldrigger, married to Godefroid de Beaudenord (See that name.) [The
Firm of Nucingen.]

ALINE, a young Auvergne chambermaid in the service of Madame Veronique
Graslin, to whom she was devoted body and soul. She was probably the
only one to whom was confided all the terrible secrets pertaining to
the life of Madame Graslin. [The Country Parson.]

ALLEGRAIN* (Christophe-Gabriel), French sculptor, born in 1710. With
Lauterbourg and Vien, at Rome, in 1758, he assisted his friend
Sarrasine to abduct Zambinella, then a famous singer. The prima-donna
was a eunuch. [Sarrasine.]

*   To the sculptor Allegrain who died in 1795, the Louvre Museum is
    indebted for a "Narcisse," a "Diana," and a "Venus entering the
    Bath."

ALPHONSE, a friend of the ruined orphan, Charles Grandet, tarrying
temporarily at Saumur. In 1819 he acquitted himself most creditably of
a mission entrusted to him by that young man. He wound up Charles'
business at Paris, paying all his debts by a single little sale.
[Eugenie Grandet.]

AL-SARTCHILD, name of a German banking-house, where Gedeon Brunner was
compelled to deposit the funds belonging to his son Frederic and
inherited from his mother. [Cousin Pons.]

ALTHOR (Jacob), a Hambourg banker, who opened up a business at Havre
in 1815. He had a son, whom in 1829 M. and Mme. Mignon desired for a
son-in-law. [Modeste Mignon.]

ALTHOR (Francisque), son of Jacob Althor. Francisque was the dandy of
Havre in 1829. He wished to marry Modeste Mignon but forsook her
quickly enough when he found out that her family was bankrupt. Not
long afterwards he married Mlle. Vilquin the elder. [Modeste Mignon.]

AMANDA, Parisian modiste at the time of Louis Philippe. Among her
customers was Marguerite Turquet, known as Malaga, who was slow in
paying bills. [A Man of Business.]

AMAURY (Madame), owner, in 1829, of a pavilion at Sauvic, near
Ingouville, which Canalis leased when he went to Havre to see Mlle.
Mignon [Modeste Mignon.]

AMBERMESNIL (Comtesse de l') went in 1819, when about thirty-six years
old, to board with the widow, Mme. Vauquer, rue Nueve Sainte-
Genevieve, now Tournefort, Paris. Mme. de l'Ambermesnil gave it out
that she was awaiting the settlement of a pension which was due her on
account of being the widow of a general killed "on the battlefield."
Mme. Vauquer gave her every attention, confiding all her own affairs
to her. The comtesse vanished at the end of six months, leaving a
board bill unsettled. Mme. Vauquer sought her eagerly, but was never
able to obtain a trace of this adventuress. [Father Goriot.]

AMEDEE, nickname bestowed on Felix de Vandenesse by Lady Dudley when
she thought she saw a rival in Madame de Mortsauf. [The Lily of the
Valley.]

ANCHISE (Pere), a surname given by La Palferine to a little Savoyard
of ten years who worked for him without pay. "I have never seen such
silliness coupled with such intelligence," the Prince of Bohemia said
of this child; "he would go through fire for me, he understands
everything, and yet he does not see that I cannot help him." [A Prince
of Bohemia.]

ANGARD--At Paris, in 1840, the "professor" Angard was consulted, in
connection with the Doctors Bianchon and Larabit, on account of Mme.
Hector Hulot, who it was feared was losing her reason. [Cousin Betty.]

ANGELIQUE (Sister), nun of the Carmelite convent at Blois under Louis
XVIII. Celebrated for her leanness. She was known by Renee de
l'Estorade (Mme. de Maucombe) and Louise de Chaulieu (Mme. Marie
Gaston), who went to school at the convent. [Letters of Two Brides.]

ANICETTE, chambermaid of the Princesse de Cadignan in 1839. The artful
and pretty Champagne girl was sought by the sub-prefect of Arcis-sur-
Aube, by Maxime de Trailles, and by Mme. Beauvisage, the mayor's wife,
each trying to bribe and enlist her on the side of one of the various
candidates for deputy. [The Member for Arcis.]

ANNETTE, Christian name of a young woman of the Parisian world, under
the Restoration. She had been brought up at Ecouen, where she had
received the practical counsels of Mme. Campan. Mistress of Charles
Grandet before his father's death. Towards the close of 1819, a prey
to suspicion, she must needs sacrifice her happiness for the time
being, so she made a weary journey with her husband into Scotland. She
made her lover effeminate and materialistic, advising with him about
everything. He returned from the Indies in 1827, when she quickly
brought about his engagement with Mlle. d'Aubrion. [Eugenie Grandet.]

ANNETTE, maid servant of Rigou at Blangy, Burgundy. She was nineteen
years old, in 1823, and had held this place for more than three years,
although Gregoire Rigou never kept servants for a longer period than
this, however much he might and did favor them. Annette, sweet,
blonde, delicate, a true masterpiece of dainty, piquant loveliness,
worthy to wear a duchess' coronet, earned nevertheless only thirty
francs a year. She kept company with Jean-Louis Tonsard without
letting her master once suspect it; ambition had prompted this young
woman to flatter her employer as a means of hoodwinking this lynx.
[The Peasantry.]

ANSELME, Jesuit, living in rue des Postes (now rue Lhomond).
Celebrated mathematician. Had some dealings with Felix Phellion, whom
he tried to convert to his religious belief. This rather meagre
information concerning him was furnished by a certain Madame Komorn.
[The Middle Classes.]

ANTOINE, born in the village of Echelles, Savoy. In 1824 he had served
longest as clerk in the Bureau of Finance, where he had secured
positions, still more modest than his own, for a couple of his
nephews, Laurent and Gabriel, both of whom were married to lace
laundresses. Antoine meddled with every act of the administration. He
elbowed, criticised, scolded and toadied to Clement Chardin des
Lupeaulx and other office-holders. He doubtless lived with his
nephews. [The Government Clerks.]

ANTOINE, old servant of the Marquise Beatrix de Rochefide, in 1840, on
the rue de Chartes-du-Roule, near Monceau Park, Paris. [Beatrix.]

ANTONIA--see Chocardelle, Mlle.

AQUILINA, a Parisian courtesan of the time of the Restoration and
Louis Philippe. She claimed to be a Piedmontese. Of her true name she
was ignorant. She had appropriated this /nom de guerre/ from a
character in the well-known tragedy by Otway, "Venice Preserved," that
she had chanced to read. At sixteen, pure and beautiful, at the time
of her downfall, she had met Castanier, Nucingen's cashier, who
resolved to save her from evil for his own gain, and live maritally
with her in the rue Richter. Aquilina then took the name of Madame de
la Garde. At the same time of her relations with Castanier, she had
for a lover a certain Leon, a petty officer in a regiment of infantry,
and none other than one of the sergeants of Rochelle to be executed on
the Place de Greve in 1822. Before this execution, in the reign of
Louis XVIII., she attended a performance of "Le Comedien d'Etampes,"
one evening at the Gymnase, when she laughed immoderately at the
comical part played by Perlet. At the same time, Castanier, also
present at this mirthful scene, but harassed by Melmoth, was
experiencing the insufferable doom of a cruel hidden drama. [Melmoth
Reconciled.] Her next appearance is at a famous orgy at the home of
Frederic Taillefer, rue Joubert, in company with Emile Blondet,
Rastignac, Bixiou and Raphael de Valentin. She was a magnificent girl
of good figure, superb carriage, and striking though irregular
features. Her glance and smile startled one. She always included some
red trinket in her attire, in memory of her executed lover. [The Magic
Skin.]

ARCOS (Comte d'), a Spanish grandee living in the Peninsula at the
time of the expedition of Napoleon I. He would probably have married
Maria-Pepita-Juana Marana de Mancini, had it not been for the peculiar
incidents which brought about her marriage with the French officer,
Francois Diard. [The Maranas.]

ARGAIOLO (Duc d'), a very rich and well-born Italian, the respected
though aged husband of her who later became the Duchesse de Rhetore,
to the perpetual grief of Albert Savarus. Argaiolo died, almost an
octogenarian, in 1835. [Albert Savarus.]

ARGAIOLO (Duchesse d'), nee Soderini, wife of the Duc d'Argaiolo. She
became a widow in 1835, and took as her second husband the Duc de
Rhetore. (See Duchesse de Rhetore.) [Albert Savarus.]

ARRACHELAINE, surname of the rogue, Ruffard. (See that name.) [Scenes
from a Courtesan's Life.]

ARTHEZ (Daniel d'), one of the most illustrious authors of the
nineteenth century, and one of those rare men who display "the unity
of excellent talent and excellent character." Born about 1794 or 1796.
A Picard gentleman. In 1821, when about twenty-five, he was poverty-
stricken and dwelt on the fifth floor of a dismal house in the rue des
Quatre-Vents, Paris, where had also resided the illustrious surgeon
Desplein, in his youth. There he fraternized with: Horace Bianchon,
then house-physician at Hotel-Dieu; Leon Giraud, the profound
philosopher; Joseph Bridau, the painter who later achieved so much
renown; Fulgence Ridal, comic poet of great sprightliness; Meyraux,
the eminent physiologist who died young; lastly, Louis Lambert and
Michel Chrestien, the Federalist Republican, both of whom were cut off
in their prime. To these men of heart and of talent Lucien de
Rubempre, the poet, sought to attach himself. He was introduced by
Daniel d'Arthez, their recognized leader. This society had taken the
name of the "Cenacle." D'Arthez and his friends advised and aided,
when in need, Lucien the "Distinguished Provincial at Paris" who ended
so tragically. Moreover, with a truly remarkable disinterestedness
d'Arthez corrected and revised "The Archer of Charles IX.," written by
Lucien, and the work became a superb book, in his hands. Another
glimpse of d'Arthez is as the unselfish friend of Marie Gaston, a
young poet of his stamp, but "effeminate." D'Arthez was swarthy, with
long locks, rather small and bearing some resemblance to Bonaparte. He
might be called the rival of Rousseau, "the Aquatic," since he was
very temperate, very pure, and drank water only. For a long time he
ate at Flicoteaux's in the Latin Quarter. He had grown famous in 1832,
besides enjoying an income of thirty thousand francs bequeathed by an
uncle who had left him a prey to the most biting poverty so long as
the author was unknown. D'Arthez then resided in a pretty house of his
own in the rue de Bellefond, where he lived in other respects as
formerly, in the rigor of work. He was a deputy sitting on the right
and upholding the Royalist platform of Divine Right. When he had
acquired a competence, he had a most vulgar and incomprehensible
/liaison/ with a woman tolerably pretty, but belonging to a lower
society and without either education or breeding. D'Arthez maintained
her, nevertheless, carefully concealing her from sight; but, far from
being a pleasurable manner of life, it became odious to him. It was at
this time that he was invited to the home of Diane de Maufrigneuse,
Princesse de Cadignan, who was then thirty-six, but did not look it.
The famous "great coquette" told him her (so-called) "secrets,"
offered herself outright to this man whom she treated as a "famous
simpleton," and whom she made her lover. After that day there was no
doubt about the relations of the princesse and Daniel d'Arthez. The
great author, whose works became very rare, appeared only during some
of the winter months at the Chamber of Deputies. [A Distinguished
Provincial at Paris. Letters of Two Brides. The Member for Arcis. The
Secrets of a Princess.]

ASIE, one of the pseudonyms of Jacqueline Collin. (see that name.)
[Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

ATHALIE, cook for Mme. Schontz in 1836. According to her mistress, she
was specially gifted in preparing venison. [The Muse of the
Department.]

AUBRION (Marquis d'), a gentleman-in-waiting of the Bedchamber, under
Charles X. He was of the house of Aubrion de Buch, whose last head
died before 1789. He was silly enough to wed a woman of fashion,
though he was already an old man of but twenty thousand francs income,
a sum hardly sufficient in Paris. He tried to marry his daughter
without a dowry to some man who was intoxicated with nobility. In
1827, to quote Mme. d'Aubrion, this ancient wreck was madly devoted to
the Duchesse de Chaulieu [Eugenie Grandet.]

AUBRION (Marquise d'), wife of the preceding. Born in 1789. At thirty-
eight she was still pretty, and, having always been somewhat aspiring,
she endeavored (in 1827), by hook or by crook, to entangle Charles
Grandet, lately returned from the Indies. She wished to make a son-in-
law out of him, and she succeeded. [Eugenie Grandet.]

AUBRION (Mathilde d') daughter of the Marquis and Marquise d'Aubrion;
born in 1808; married to Charles Grandet. (See that name.) [Eugenie
Grandet.]

AUBRION (Comte d'), the title acquired by Charles Grandet after his
marriage to the daughter of the Marquis d'Aubrion. [The Firm of
Nucingen.]

AUFFRAY, grocer at Provins, in the period of Louis XV., Louis XVI. and
the Revolution. M. Auffray married the first time when eighteen, the
second time at sixty-nine. By his first wife he had a rather ugly
daughter who married, at sixteen, a landlord of Provins, Rogron by
name. Auffray had another daughter, by his second marriage, a charming
girl, this time, who married a Breton captain in the Imperial Guard.
Pierrette Lorrain was the daughter of this officer. The old grocer
Auffray died at the time of the Empire without having had time enough
to make his will. The inheritance was so skillfully manipulated by
Rogron, the first son-in-law of the deceased, that almost nothing was
left for the goodman's widow, then only about thirty-eight years old.
[Pierrette.]

AUFFRAY (Madame), wife of the preceding. (See Neraud, Mme.)
[Pierrette.]

AUFFRAY, a notary of Provins in 1827. Husband of Mme. Guenee's third
daughter. Great-grand-nephew of the old grocer, Auffray. Appointed a
guardian of Pierrette Lorrain. On account of the ill-treatment to
which this young girl was subjected at the home of her guardian, Denis
Rogron, she was removed, an invalid, to the home of the notary
Auffray, a designated guardian, where she died, although tenderly
cared for. [Pierrette.]

AUFFRAY (Madame), born Guenee. Wife of the preceding. The third
daughter of Mme. Guenee, born Tiphaine. She exhibited the greatest
kindness for Pierrette Lorrain, and nursed her tenderly in her last
illness. [Pierrette.]

AUGUSTE, name borne by Boislaurier, as chief of "brigands," in the
uprisings of the West under the Republic and under the Empire. [The
Seamy Side of History.]

AUGUSTE, /valet de chambre/ of the General Marquis Armand de
Montriveau, under the Restoration, at the time when the latter dwelt
in the rue de Seine hard by the Chamber of Peers, and was intimate
with the Duchesse Antoinette de Langeais. [The Thirteen.]

AUGUSTE, notorious assassin, executed in the first years of the
Restoration. He left a mistress, surnamed Rousse, to whom Jacques
Collin had faithfully remitted (in 1819) some twenty odd thousands of
francs, on behalf of her lover after his execution. This woman was
married in 1821, by Jacques Collin's sister, to the head clerk of a
rich, wholesale hardware merchant. Nevertheless, though once more in
respectable society, she remained bound, by a secret compact, to the
terrible Vautrin and his sister. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

AUGUSTE (Madame), dressmaker of Esther Gobseck, and her creditor in
the time of Louis XVIII. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

AUGUSTIN, /valet de chambre/ of M. de Serizy in 1822. [A Start in
Life.]

AURELIE, a Parisian courtesan, under Louis Philippe, at the time when
Mme. Fabien du Ronceret commenced her conquests. [Beatrix.]

called Schontz, who became, later, Mme. Fabien du Ronceret. [Beatrix.]

AUVERGNAT (L'), one of the assumed names of the rogue Selerier, alias
Pere Ralleau, alias Rouleur, alias Fil-de-soie. (See Selerier.)
[Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]



B

BABYLAS, groom or "tiger" of Amedee de Soulas, in 1834, at Besancon.
Was fourteen years old at this time. The son of one of his master's
tenants. He earned thirty-six francs a month by his position to
support himself, but he was neat and skillful. [Albert Savarus.]

BAPTISTE, /valet de chambre/ to the Duchesse de Lenoncourt-Chaulieu in
1830. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

BARBANCHU, Bohemian with a cocked hat, who was called into Vefour's by
some journalists who breakfasted there at the expense of Jerome
Thuillier, in 1840, and invited by them to "sponge" off of this urbane
man, which he did. [The Middle Classes.]

BARBANTI (The), a Corsican family who brought about the reconciliation
of the Piombos and the Portas in 1800. [The Vendetta.]

BARBET, a dynasty of second-hand book-dealers in Paris under the
Restoration and Louis Philippe. They were Normans. In 1821 and the
years following, one of them ran a little shop on the quay des Grands-
Augustins, and purchased Lousteau's books. In 1836, a Barbet, partner
in a book-shop with Metivier and Morand, owned a wretched house on the
rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs and the boulevard du Mont-Parnasse, where
dwelt the Baron Bourlac with his daughter and grandson. In 1840 the
Barbets had become regular usurers dealing in credits with the firm of
Cerizet and Company. The same year a Barbet occupied, in a house
belonging to Jerome Thuillier, rue Saint-Dominique-d'Enfer (now rue
Royal-Collard), a room on the first flight up and a shop on the ground
floor. He was then a "publisher's shark." Barbet junior, a nephew of
the foregoing, and editor in the alley des Panoramas, placed on the
market at this time a brochure composed by Th. de la Peyrade but
signed by Thuillier and having the title "Capital and Taxes." [A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris. A Man of Business. The Seamy Side
of History. The Middle Classes.]

BARBETTE, wife of the great Cibot, known as Galope-Chopine. (See
Cibot, Barbette.) [Les Chouans.]

BARCHOU DE PENHOEN (Auguste-Theodore-Hilaire), born at Morlaix
(Finistere), April 28, 1801, died at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, July 29,
1855. A school-mate of Balzac, Jules Dufaure and Louis Lambert, and
his neighbors in the college dormitory of Vendome in 1811. Later he
was an officer, then a writer of transcendental philosophy, a
translator of Fichte, a friend and interpreter of Ballanche. In 1849
he was elected, by his fellow-citizens of Finistere, to the
Legislative Assembly where he represented the Legitimists and the
Catholics. He protested against the /coup d'etat/ of December 2, 1851
(See "The Story of a Crime," by Victor Hugo). When a child he came
under the influence of Pyrrhonism. He once gainsaid the talent of
Louis Lambert, his Vendome school-mate. [Louis Lambert.]

BARGETON (De), born between 1761 and 1763. Great-grandson of an
Alderman of Bordeau named Mirault, ennobled during the reign of Louis
XIII., and whose son, under Louis XIV., now Mirault de Bargeton, was
an officer of the Guards de la Porte. He owned a house at Angouleme,
in the rue du Minage, where he lived with his wife, Marie-Louise-Anais
de Negrepelisse, to whom he was entirely obedient. On her account, and
at her instigation, he fought with one of the habitues of his salon,
Stanislas de Chandour, who had circulated in the town a slander on
Mme. de Bargeton. Bargeton lodged a bullet in his opponent's neck. He
had for a second his father-in-law, M. de Negrepelisse. Following
this, M. de Bargeton retired into his estate at Escarbas, near
Barbezieux, while his wife, as a result of the duel left Angouleme for
Paris. M. de Bargeton had been of good physique, but "injured by
youthful excesses." He was commonplace, but a great gourmand. He died
of indigestion towards the close of 1821. [Lost Illusions.]

BARGETON (Madame de), nee Marie-Louise-Anais Negrepelisse, wife of the
foregoing. Left a widow, she married again, this time the Baron Sixte
du Chatelet. (See that name.)

BARILLAUD, known by Frederic Alain whose suspicion he aroused with
regard to Monegod. [The Seamy Side of History.]

BARIMORE (Lady), daughter of Lord Dudley, and apparently the wife of
Lord Barimore, although it is a disputed question. Just after 1830,
she helped receive at a function of Mlle. des Touches, rue de la
Chaussee-d'Antin, where Marsay told about his first love affair.
[Another Study of Woman.]

BARKER (William), one of Vautrin's "incarnations." In 1824 or 1825,
under this assumed name, he posed as one of the creditors of M.
d'Estourny, making him endorse some notes of Cerizet's, the partner of
this M. d'Estourny. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

BARNHEIM, family in good standing at Bade. On the maternal side, the
family of Mme. du Ronceret, nee Schiltz, alias Schontz. [Beatrix.]

BARNIOL, Phellion's son-in-law. Head of an academy (in 1840), rue
Saint-Hyacinthe-Saint-Michel (now, rue Le Goff and rue Malebrache). A
rather influential man in the Faubourg Saint-Jacques. Visited the
salon of Thuillier. [The Middle Classes.]

BARNIOL (Madame), nee Phellion, wife of the preceding. She had been
under-governess in the boarding school of the Mlles. Lagrave, rue
Notre-Dame des Champs. [The Middle Classes.]

BARRY (John), a young English huntsman, well known in the district
whence the Prince of Loudon brought him to employ him at his own home.
He was with this great lord in 1829, 1830. [Modeste Mignon.]

BARTAS (Adrien de), of Angouleme. In 1821, he and his wife were very
devoted callers at the Bargetons. M. de Bartas gave himself up
entirely to music, talking about this subject incessantly, and
courting invitations to sing with his heavy bass voice. He posed as
the lover of Mme. de Brebion, the wife of his best friend. M. de
Brebion became the lover of Mme. de Bartas. [Lost Illusions.]

BARTAS (Madame Josephine de), wife of the preceding, always called
Fifine, "for short." [Lost Illusions.]

BASTIENNE, Parisian modiste in 1821. Finot's journal vaunted her hats,
for a pecuniary consideration, and derogated those of Virginie,
formerly praised. [Lost Illusions.]

BATAILLES (The), belonging to the bourgeoisie of Paris, traders of
Marais, neighbors and friends of the Baudoyers and the Saillards in
1824. M. Bataille was a captain in the National Guard, a fact which he
allowed no one to ignore. [The Government Clerks.]

BAUDENORD (Godefroid de), born in 1800. In 1821 he was one of the
kings of fashion, in company with Marsay, Vandenesse, Ajuda-Pinto,
Maxime de Trailles, Rastignac, the Duc de Maufrigneuse and Manerville.
[A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] His nobility and breeding were
perhaps not very orthodox. According to Mlle. Emilie de Fontaine, he
was of bad figure and stout, having but a single advantage--that of
his brown locks. [The Ball at Sceaux.] A cousin, by marriage, of his
guardian, the Marquis d'Aiglemont, he was, like him, ruined by the
Baron de Nucingen in the Wortschin mine deal. At one time Beaudenord
thought of paying court to his pretty cousin, the Marquise
d'Aiglemont. In 1827 he wedded Isaure d'Aldrigger and, after having
lived with her in a cosy little house on the rue de le Planche, he was
obliged to solicit employment of the Minister of Finance, a position
which he lost on account of the Revolution of 1830. However, he was
reinstated through the influence of Nucingen, in 1836. He now lived
modestly with his mother-in-law, his unmarried sister-in-law, Malvina,
his wife and four children which she had given him, on the third
floor, over the entresol, rue du Mont-Thabor. [The Firm of Nucingen.]

BAUDENORD (Madame de), wife of the preceding. Born Isaure d'Aldrigger,
in 1807, at Strasbourg. An indolent blonde, fond of dancing, but a
nonentity from both the moral and the intellectual standpoints. [The
Firm of Nucingen.]

BAUDOYER (Monsieur and Madame), formerly tanners at Paris, rue
Censier. They owned their house, besides having a country seat at
l'Isle Adam. They had but one child, Isidore, whose sketch follows.
Mme. Baudoyer, born Mitral, was the sister of the bailiff of that
name. [The Government Clerks.]

BAUDOYER (Isidore), born in 1788; only son of M. and Mme. Baudoyer,
tanners, rue Censier, Paris. Having finished a course of study, he
obtained a position in the Bureau of Finance, where, despite his
notorious incapacity--and through "wire-pulling"--he became head of
the office. In 1824, a head of the division, M. de La Billardiere
died, when the meritorious clerk, Xavier Rabourdin, aspired to succeed
him; but the position went to Isidore Baudoyer, who was backed by the
power of money and the influence of the Church. He did not retain this
post long; six months thereafter he became a preceptor at Paris.
Isidore Baudoyer lived with his wife and her parents in a house on
Palais Royale (now Place des Vosges), of which they were joint owners.
[The Government Clerks.] He dined frequently, in 1840, at Thuillier's,
an old employe of the Bureau of Finance, then domiciled at the rue
Saint-Dominique-d'Enfer, who had renewed his acquaintance with his
old-time colleagues. [The Middle Classes.] In 1845, this man, who had
been a model husband and who made a great pretence of religion
maintained Heloise Brisetout. He was then mayor of the arrondissement
of the Palais Royale. [Cousin Pons.]

BAUDOYER (Madame), wife of the preceding and daughter of a cashier of
the Minister of Finance; born Elisabeth Saillard in 1795. Her mother,
an Auvergnat, had an uncle, Bidault, alias Gigonnet, a short-time
money lender in the Halles quarter. On the other side, her mother-in-
law was the sister of the bailiff Mitral. Thanks to these two men of
means, who exercised a veritable secret power, and through her piety,
which put her on good terms with the clergy, she succeeded in raising
her husband up to the highest official positions--profiting also by
the financial straits of Clement Chardin des Lupeaulx, Secretary
General of Finance. [The Government Clerks.]

BAUDOYER (Mademoiselle), daughter of Isidore Baudoyer and Elisabeth
Saillard, born in 1812. Reared by her parents with the idea of
becoming the wife of the shrewd and energetic speculator Martin
Falleix, brother of Jacques Falleix the stock-broker. [The Government
Clerks.]

BAUDRAND, cashier of a boulevard theatre, of which Gaudissart became
the director about 1834. In 1845 he was succeeded by the proletariat
Topinard. [Cousin Pons.]

BAUDRY (Planat de), Receiver General of Finances under the
Restoration. He married one of the daughters of the Comte de Fontaine.
He usually passed his summers at Sceaux, with almost all his wife's
family. [The Ball at Sceaux.]

BAUVAN (Comte de), one of the instigators of the Chouan insurrection
in the department d'Ille-et-Vilaine, in 1799. Through a secret
revelation made to his friend the Marquis de Montauran on the part of
Mlle. de Verneuil, the Comte de Bauvan caused, indirectly, the
Massacre des Bleus at Vivetiere. Later, surprised in an ambuscade by
soldiers of the Republic, he was made a prisoner by Mlle. de Verneuil
and owed his life to her; for this reason he became entirely devoted
to her, assisting as a witness at her marriage with Montauran. [The
Chouans.]

BAUVAN (Comtesse de), in all likelihood the wife of the foregoing,
whom she survived. In 1822 she was manager of a Parisian lottery
bureau which employed Madame Agatha Bridau, about the same time. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

BAUVAN (Comte and Comtesse de), father and mother of Octave de Bauvan.
Relics of the old Court, living in a tumble-down house on the rue
Payenne at Paris, where they died, about 1815, within a few months of
each other, and before the conjugal infelicity of their son. (See
Octave de Bauvan.) Probably related to the two preceding. [Honorine.]

BAUVAN (Comte Octave de), statesman and French magistrate. Born in
1787. When twenty-six he married Honorine, a beautiful young heiress
who had been reared carefully at the home of his parents, M. and Mme.
de Bauvan, whose ward she was. Two or three years afterwards she left
the conjugal roof, to the infinite despair of the comte, who gave
himself over entirely to winning her back again. At the end of several
years he succeeded in getting her to return to him through pity, but
she died soon after this reconciliation, leaving one son born of their
reunion. The Comte de Bauvan, completely broken, set out for Italy
about 1836. He had two residences at Paris, one on rue Payenne, an
heirloom, the other on Faubourg Saint-Honore, which was the scene of
the domestic reunion. [Honorine.] In 1830, the Comte de Bauvan, then
president of the Court of Cassation, with MM. de Granville and de
Serizy, tried to save Lucien de Rubempre from a criminal judgment,
and, after the suicide of that unhappy man, he followed his remains to
the grave. [Scenes from a Courtesan's life.]

BAUVAN (Comtesse Honorine de), wife of the preceding. Born in 1794.
Married at nineteen to the Comte Octave de Bauvan. After having
abandoned her husband, she was in turn, while expecting a child,
abandoned by her lover, some eighteen months later. She then lived a
very retired life in the rue Saint-Maur, yet all the time being under
the secret surveillance of the Comte de Bauvan who paid exorbitant
prices for the artificial flowers which she made. She thus derived
from him a rather large part of the sustenance which she believed she
owed only to her own efforts. She died, reunited to her husband,
shortly after the Revolution of July, 1830. Honorine de Bauvan lost
her child born out of wedlock, and she always mourned it. During her
years of toilsome exile in the Parisian faubourg, she came in contact
successively with Marie Gobain, Jean-Jules Popinot, Felix Gaudissart,
Maurice de l'Hostal and Abbe Loraux.[Honorine.]

BEAUDENORD (Madame de), wife of the preceding. Born Isaure
d'Aldrigger, in 1807, at Strasbourg. An indolent blonde, fond of
dancing, but a nonentity from both the moral and the intellectual
standpoints. [The Firm of Nucingen.]

BEAUMESNIL (Mademoiselle), a celebrated actress of the Theatre-
Francais, Paris. Mature at the time of the Restoration. She was the
mistress of the police-officer Peyrade, by whom she had a daughter,
Lydie, whom he acknowledged. The last home of Mlle. Beaumesnil was on
rue de Tournon. It was there that she suffered the loss by theft of
her valuable diamonds, through Charles Crochard, her real lover. This
was at the beginning of the reign of Louis Philippe. [The Middle
Classes. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. A Second Home.]

BEAUPIED, or Beau-Pied, an alias of Jean Falcon. (See that name.)

BEAUPRE (Fanny), an actress at the Theatre de la Porte-Saint-Martin,
Paris, time of Charles X. Young and beautiful, in 1825, she made a
name for herself in the role of marquise in a melodrama entitled "La
Famille d'Anglade." At this time she had replaced Coralie, then dead,
in the affections of Camusot the silk-merchant. It was at Fanny
Beaupre's that Oscar Husson, one of the clerks of lawyer Desroches,
lost in gaming the sum of five hundred francs belonging to his
employer, and that he was discovered lying dead-drunk on a sofa by his
uncle Cardot. [A Start in Life.] In 1829 Fanny Beaupre, for a money
consideration, posed as the best friend of the Duc d'Herouville.
[Modeste Mignon.] In 1842, after his liaison with Mme. de la Baudraye,
Lousteau lived maritally with her. [The Muse of the Department.] A
frequent inmate of the mansion magnificently fitted up for Esther
Gobseck by the Baron de Nucingen, she knew all the fast set of the
years 1829 and 1830. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

BEAUSEANT (Marquis and Comte de), the father and eldest brother of the
Vicomte de Beauseant, husband of Claire de Bourgogne. [The Deserted
Woman.] In 1819, the marquis and the comte dwelt together in their
house, rue Saint-Dominique, Paris. [Father Goriot.] While the
Revolution was on, the marquis had emigrated. The Abbe de Marolles had
dealings with him. [An Episode under the Terror.]

BEAUSEANT (Marquise de). In 1824 a Marquise de Beauseant, then rather
old, is found to have dealings with the Chaulieus. It was probably the
widow of the marquis of this name, and the mother of the Comte and
Vicomte de Beauseant. [Letters of Two Brides.] The Marquise de
Beauseant was a native of Champagne, coming of a very old family. [The
Deserted Woman.]

BEAUSEANT (Vicomte de), husband of Claire de Bourgogne. He understood
the relations of his wife with Miguel d'Ajuda-Pinto, and, whether he
liked it or not, he respected this species of morganatic alliance
recognized by society. The Vicomte de Beauseant had his residence in
Paris on the rue de Grenelle in 1819. At that time he kept a dancer
and liked nothing better than high living. He became a marquis on the
death of his father and eldest brother. He was a polished man,
courtly, methodical, and ceremonious. He insisted upon living
selfishly. His death would have allowed Mme. de Beauseant to wed
Gaston de Nueil. [Father Goriot. The Deserted Woman.]

BEAUSEANT (Vicomtesse de), born Clair de Bourgogne, in 1792. Wife of
the preceding and cousin of Eugene de Rastignac. Of a family almost
royal. Deceived by her lover, Miguel d'Ajuda-Pinto, who, while
continuing his intimacy with her, asked and obtained the hand of
Berthe de Rochefide, the vicomtesse left Paris secretly before this
wedding and on the morning following a grand ball which was given at
her home where she shone in all her pride and splendor. In 1822 this
"deserted woman" had lived for three years in the most rigid seclusion
at Courcelles near Bayeux. Gaston de Nueil, a young man of three and
twenty, who had been sent to Normandy for his health, succeeded in
making her acquaintance, was immediately smitten with her and, after a
long seige, became her lover. This was at Geneva, whither she had
fled. Their intimacy lasted for nine years, being broken by the
marriage of the young man. In 1819 the Vicomtesse de Beauseant
received at Paris the most famous "high-rollers" of the day--
Malincour, Ronquerolles, Maxime de Trailles, Marsay, Vandenesse,
together with an intermingling of the most elegant dames, as Lady
Brandon, the Duchesse de Langeais, the Comtesse de Kergarouet, Mme. de
Serizy, the Duchesse Carigliano, the Comtesse Ferraud, Mme. de Lantry,
the Marquise d'Aiglemont, Mme. Firmiani, the Marquise de Listomere,
the Marquise d'Espard and the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse. She was
equally intimate with Grandlieu, and the General de Montriveau.
Rastignac, then poor at the time of his start in the world, also
received cards to her receptions. [Father Goriot. The Deserted Woman.
Albert Savarus.]

BEAUSSIER, a bourgeois of Issoudun under the Restoration. Upon seeing
Joseph Bridau in the diligence, while the artist and his mother were
on a journey in 1822, he remarked that he would not care to meet him
at night in the corner of a forest--he looked so much like a
highwayman. That same evening Beaussier, accompanied by his wife, came
to call at Hochon's in order to get a nearer view of the painter. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

BEAUSSIER the younger, known as Beaussier the Great; son of the
preceding and one of the Knights of Idlesse at Issoudun, commanded by
Maxence Gilet, under the Restoration. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

BEAUVISAGE, physician of the Convent des Carmelites at Blois, time of
Louis XVIII. He was known by Louise de Chaulieu and by Renee de
Maucombe, who were reared in the convent. According to Louise de
Chaulieu, he certainly belied his name. [Letters of Two Brides.]

BEAUVISAGE, at one time tenant of the splendid farm of Bellache,
pertaining to the Gondreville estate at Arcis-sur-Aube. The father of
Phileas Beauvisage. Died about the beginning of the nineteenth
century. [The Gondreville Mystery. The Member for Arcis.]

BEAUVISAGE (Madame), wife of the preceding. She survived him for quite
a long period and helped her son Phileas win his success. [The Member
for Arcis.]

BEAUVISAGE (Phileas), son of Beauvisage the farmer. Born in 1792. A
hosier at Arcis-sur-Aube during the Restoration. Mayor of the town in
1839. After a preliminary defeat he was elected deputy at the time
when Sallenauve sent in his resignation, in 1841. An ardent admirer of
Crevel whose affectations he aped. A millionaire and very vain, he
would have been able, according to Crevel, to advance Mme. Hulot, for
a consideration, the two hundred thousand francs of which that unhappy
lady stood in so dire a need about 1842. [Cousin Betty. The Member for
Arcis.]

BEAUVISAGE (Madame), born Severine Grevin in 1795. Wife of Phileas
Beauvisage, whom she kept in complete subjugation. Daughter of Grevin
the notary of Arcis-sur-Aube, Senator Malin de Gondreville's intimate
friend. She inherited her father's marvelous faculty of discretion;
and, though diminutive in stature, reminded one forcibly, in her face
and ways, of Mlle. Mars. [The Member for Arcis.]

BEAUVISAGE (Cecile-Renee), only daughter of Phileas Beauvisage and
Severine Grevin. Born in 1820. Her natural father was the Vicomte
Melchior de Chargeboeuf who was sub-prefect of Arcis-sur-Aube at the
commencement of the Restoration. She looked exactly like him, besides
having his aristocratic airs. [The Member for Arcis.]

BEAUVOIR (Charles-Felix-Theodore, Chevalier de), cousin of the
Duchesse de Maille. A Chouan prisoner of the Republic in the chateau
de l'Escarpe in 1799. The hero of a tale of marital revenge related by
Lousteau, in 1836, to Mme. de la Baudraye, the story being obtained--
so the narrator said--from Charles Nodier. [The Muse of the
Department.]

BECANIERE (La), surname of Barbette Cibot. (See that name.)

BECKER (Edme), a student of medicine who dwelt in 1828 at number 22,
rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Genevieve--the residence of the Marquis
d'Espard. [The Commission in Lunacy.]

BEDEAU, office boy and roustabout for Maitre Bordin, attorney to the
Chatelet in 1787. [A Start in Life.]

BEGA, surgeon in a French regiment of the Army of Spain in 1808. After
having privately accouched a Spaniard under the espionage of her
lover, he was assassinated by her husband, who surprised him in the
telling of this clandestine operation. The foregoing adventure was
told Mme. de la Baudraye, in 1836, by the Receiver of Finances,
Gravier, former paymaster of the Army. [The Muse of the Department.]

BEGRAND (La), a dancer at the theatre of Porte-Sainte-Martin, Paris,
in 1820.* Mariette, who made her debut at this time, also scored a
success. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

*   She shone for more than sixty years as a famous choreographical
    artist in the boulevards.

BELLEFEUILLE (Mademoiselle de), assumed name of Caroline Crochard.

BELLEJAMBE, servant of Lieutenant-Colonel Husson in 1837. [A Start in
Life.]

BELOR (Mademoiselle de), young girl of Bordeaux living there about
1822. She was always in search of a husband, whom, for some cause or
other, she never found. Probably intimate with Evangelista. [A
Marriage Settlement.]

BEMBONI (Monsignor), attache to the Secretary of State at Rome, who
was entrusted with the transmission to the Duc de Soria at Madrid of
the letters of Baron de Macumer his brother, a Spanish refugee at
Paris in 1823, 1824. [Letters of Two Brides.]

BENARD (Pieri). After corresponding with a German for two years, he
discovered an engraving by Muller entitled the "Virgin of Dresden." It
was on Chinese paper and made before printing was discovered. It cost
Cesar Birotteau fifteen hundred francs. The perfumer destined this
engraving for the savant Vauquelin, to whom he was under obligations.
[Cesar Birotteau.]

BENASSIS (Doctor), born about 1779 in a little town of Languedoc. He
received his early training at the College of Soreze, Tarn, which was
managed by the Oratorians. After that he pursued his medical studies
at Paris, residing in the Latin quarter. When twenty-two he lost his
father, who left him a large fortune; and he deserted a young girl by
whom he had had a son, in order to give himself over to the most
foolish dissipations. This young girl, who was thoroughly well meant
and devoted to him, died two years after the desertion despite the
most tender care of her now contrite lover. Later Benassis sought
marriage with another young girl belonging to a Jansenist family. At
first the affair was settled, but he was thrown over when the secret
of his past life, hitherto concealed, was made known. He then devoted
his whole life to his son, but the child died in his youth. After
wavering between suicide and the monastery of Grande-Chartreuse,
Doctor Benassis stopped by chance in the poor village of l'Isere, five
leagues from Grenoble. He remained there until he had transformed the
squalid settlement, inhabited by good-for-nothing Cretins, into the
chief place of the Canton, bustling and prosperous. Benassis died in
1829, mayor of the town. All the populace mourned the benefactor and
man of genius. [The Country Doctor.]

BENEDETTO, an Italian living at Rome in the first third of the
nineteenth century. A tolerable musician, and a police spy, "on the
side." Ugly, small and a drunkard, he was nevertheless the lucky
husband of Luigia, whose marvelous beauty was his continual boast.
After an evening spent by him over the wine-cups, his wife in loathing
lighted a brasier of charcoal, after carefully closing all the exits
of the bedchamber. The neighbors rushing in succeeded in saving her
alone; Benedetto was dead. [The Member for Arcis.]

BERENICE, chambermaid and cousin of Coralie the actress of the
Panorama and Gymnase Dramatique. A large Norman woman, as ugly as her
mistress was pretty, but tender and sympathetic in direct proportion
to her corpulence. She had been Coralie's childhood playmate and was
absolutely bound up in her. In October, 1822, she gave Lucien de
Rubempre, then entirely penniless, four five-franc pieces which she
undoubtedly owed to the generosity of chance lovers met on the
boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle. This sum enabled the unfortunate poet to
return to Angouleme. [Lost Illusions. A Distinguished Provincial at
Paris.]

BERGERIN was the best doctor at Saumur during the Restoration. He
attended Felix Grandet in his last illness. [Eugenie Grandet.]

BERGMANN (Monsieur and Madame), Swiss. Venerable gardeners of a
certain Comte Borromeo, tending his parks located on the two famous
isles in Lake Major. In 1823 they owned a house at Gersau, near
Quatre-Canton Lake, in the Canton of Lucerne. For a year back they had
let one floor of this house to the Prince and Princesse Gandolphini,--
personages of a novel entitled, "L'Ambitieux par Amour," published by
Albert Savarus in the Revue de l'Est, in 1834. [Albert Savarus.]

BERNARD. (See Baron de Bourlac.)

BERNUS, diligence messenger carrying the passengers, freight, and
perhaps, the letters of Saint-Nazaire to Guerande, during the time of
Charles X. and Louis Philippe. [Beatrix.]

BERQUET, workman of Besancon who erected an elevated kiosk in the
garden of the Wattevilles, whence their daughter Rosalie could see
every act and movement of Albert Savarus, a near neighbor. [Albert
Savarus.]

BERTHIER (Alexandre), marshal of the Empire, born at Versailles in
1753, dying in 1815. He wrote, as Minister of War at the close of
1799, to Hulot, then in command of the Seventy-second demi-brigade,
refusing to accept his resignation and giving him further orders. [The
Chouans.] On the evening of the battle of Jena, October 13, 1806, he
accompanied the Emperor and was present at the latter's interview with
the Marquis de Chargeboeuf and Laurence de Cinq-Cygne, special envoys
to France to implore pardon for the Simeuses, the Hauteserres, and
Michu who had been condemned as abductors of Senator Malin de
Gondreville. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

BERTHIER, Parisian notary, successor of Cardot, whose assistant head-
clerk he had been and whose daughter Felicite (or Felicie) he married.
In 1843 he was Mme. Marneffe's notary. At the same time he had in hand
the affairs of Camusot de Marville; and Sylvain Pons often dined with
him. Master Berthier drew up the marriage settlement of Wilhelm Schwab
with Emilie Graff, and the copartnership articles between Fritz
Brunner and Wilhelm Schwab. [Cousin Betty. Cousin Pons.]

BERTHIER (Madame), nee Felicie Cardot, wife of the preceding. She had
been wronged by the chief-clerk in her father's office. This young man
died suddenly, leaving her enceinte. She then espoused the second
clerk, Berthier, in 1837, after having been on the point of accepting
Lousteau. Berthier was cognizant of all the head-clerk's doings. In
this affair both acted for a common interest. The marriage was
measurably happy. Madame Berthier was so grateful to her husband that
she made herself his slave. About the end of 1844 she welcomed very
coldly Sylvain Pons, then in disgrace in the family circle. [The Muse
of the Department. Cousin Pons.]

BERTON, tax-collector at Arcis-sur-Aube in 1839. [The Member for
Arcis.]

BERTON (Mademoiselle), daughter of the tax-collector of Arcis-sur-
Aube. A young, insignificant girl who acted the satellite to Cecile
Beauvisage and Ernestine Mollot. [The Member for Arcis.]

BERTON (Doctor), physician of Paris. In 1836 he lived on rue d'Enfer
(now rue Denfert-Rochereau). An assistant in the benevolent work of
Mme. de la Chanterie, he visited the needy sick whom she pointed out.
Among others he attended Vanda de Mergi, daughter of the Baron de
Bourlac--M. Bernard. Doctor Berton was gruff and frigid. [The Seamy
Side of History.]

BETHUNE (Prince de), the only man of fashion who knew "what a hat was"
--to quote a saying of Vital the hatter, in 1845. [The Unconscious
Humorists.]

BEUNIER & CO., the firm Bixiou inquired after in 1845, near Mme.
Nourrisson's. [The Unconscious Humorists.]

BIANCHI. Italian. During the first Empire a captain in the sixth
regiment of the French line, which was made up almost entirely of men
of his nationality. Celebrated in his company for having bet that he
would eat the heart of a Spanish sentinel, and winning that bet.
Captain Bianchi was first to plant the French colors on the wall of
Tarragone, Spain, in the attack of 1808. But a friar killed him. [The
Maranas.]

BIANCHON (Doctor), a physician of Sancerre, father of Horace Bianchon,
brother of Mme. Popinot, the wife of Judge Popinot. [The Commission in
Lunacy.]

BIANCHON (Horace), a physician of Paris, celebrated during the times
of Charles X. and Louis Philippe; an officer of the Legion of Honor,
member of the Institute, professor of the Medical Faculty, physician-
in-charge, at the same time, of a hospital and the Ecole
Polytechnique. Born at Sancerre, Cher, about the end of the eighteenth
century. He was "interne" at the Cochin Hospital in 1819, at which
time he boarded at the Vauquer Pension where he knew Eugene de
Rastignac, then studying law, and Goriot and Vautrin. [Father Goriot.]
Shortly thereafter, at Hotel Dieu, he became the favored pupil of the
surgeon Desplein, whose last days he tended. [The Atheist's Mass.]
Nephew of Judge Jean-Jules Popinot and relative of Anselme Popinot, he
had dealings with the perfumer Cesar Birotteau, who acknowledged
indebtedness to him for a prescription of his famous hazelnut oil, and
who invited him to the grand ball which precipitated Birotteau's
bankruptcy. [Cesar Birotteau. The Commission in Lunacy.] Member of the
"Cenacle" in rue des Quatre-Vents, and on intimate terms with all the
young fellows composing this clique, he was consequently enabled, to
an extent, to bring Daniel d'Arthez to the notice of Rastignac, now
Under-Secretary of State. He nursed Lucien de Rubempre who was wounded
in a duel with Michel Chrestien in 1822; also Coralie, Lucien's
mistress, and Mme. Bridau in their last illnesses. [Lost Illusions. A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris. A Bachelor's Establishment. The
Secrets of a Princess.] In 1824 the young Doctor Bianchon accompanied
Desplein, who was called in to attend the dying Flamet de la
Billardiere. [The Government Clerks.] In Provins in 1828, with the
same Desplein and Dr. Martener, he gave the most assiduous attention
to Pierrette Lorrain. [Pierrette.] In this same year of 1828 he had a
momentary desire to become one of an expedition to Morea. He was then
physician to Mme. de Listomere, whose misunderstanding with Rastignac
he learned and afterwards related. [A Study of Woman.] Again in
company with Desplein, in 1829, he was called in by Mme. de Nucingen
with the object of studying the case of Baron de Nucingen, her
husband, love-sick for Esther Gobseck. In 1830, still with his
celebrated chief, he was cited by Corentin to express an opinion on
the death of Peyrade and the lunacy of Lydie his daughter. Then, with
Desplein and with Dr. Sinard, to attend Mme. de Serizy, who it was
feared would go crazy over the suicide of Lucien de Rubempre. [Scenes
from a Courtesan's Life.] Associated with Desplein, at this same time,
he cared for the dying Honorine, wife of Comte de Bauvan [Honorine.],
and examined the daughter of Baron de Bourlac--M. Bernard--who was
suffering from a peculiar Polish malady, the plica. [The Seamy Side of
History.] In 1831 Horace Bianchon was the friend and physician of
Raphael de Valentin. [The Magic Skin.] In touch with the Comte de
Granville in 1833, he attended the latter's mistress, Caroline
Crochard. [A Second Home.] He also attended Mme. du Bruel, then
mistress of La Palferine, who had injured herself by falling and
striking her head against the sharp corner of a fireplace. [A Prince
of Bohemia.] In 1835 he attended Mme. Marie Gaston--Louise de Chaulieu
--though a hopeless case. [Letters of Two Brides.] In 1837 at Paris he
accouched Mme. de la Baudraye who had been intimate with Lousteau; he
was assisted by the celebrated accoucheur Duriau. [The Muse of the
Department.] In 1838 he was Comte Laginski's physician. [The Imaginary
Mistress.] In 1840 Horace Bianchon resided on rue de la Montagne-
Sainte-Genevieve, in the house where his uncle, Judge Popinot, died,
and he was asked to become one of the Municipal Council, in place of
that upright magistrate. But he declined, declaring in favor of
Thuillier. [The Middle Classes.] The physician of Baron Hulot, Crevel
and Mme. Marneffe, he observed with seven of his colleagues, the
terrible malady which carried off Valerie and her second husband in
1842. In 1843 he also visited Lisbeth Fisher in her last illness
[Cousin Betty.] Finally, in 1844, Dr. Bianchon was consulted by Dr.
Roubaud regarding Mme. Graslin at Montegnac. [The Country Parson.]
Horace Bianchon was a brilliant and inspiring conversationalist. He
gave to society the adventures known by the following titles: A Study
of Woman; Another Study of Woman; La Grande Breteche.

BIBI-LUPIN, chief of secret police between 1819 and 1830; a former
convict. In 1819 he personally arrested at Mme. Vauquer's boarding-
house Jacques Collin, alias Vautrin, his old galley-mate and personal
enemy. Under the name of Gondureau, Bibi-Lupin had made overtures to
Mlle. Michonneau, one of Mme. Vauquer's guests, and through her he had
obtained the necessary proofs of the real identity of Vautrin who was
then without the pale of the law, but who later, May, 1830, became his
successor as chief of secret police. [Father Goriot. Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.]

BIDAULT (Monsieur and Madame), brother and sister-in-law of Bidault,
alias Gigonnet; father and mother of M. and Mme. Saillard, furniture-
dealers under the Central Market pillars during the latter part of the
eighteenth and perhaps the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. [The
Government Clerks.]

BIDAULT, known as Gigonnet, born in 1755; originally an Auvergnat;
uncle of Mme. Saillard on the paternal side. A paper-merchant at one
time, retired from business since the year II of the Republic, he
opened an account with a Dutchman called Sieur Werbrust, who was a
friend of Gobseck. In business relations with the latter, he was one
of the most formidable usurers in Paris, during the Empire, the
Restoration and the first part of the July Government. He dwelt in rue
Greneta. [The Government Clerks. Gobseck.] Luigi Porta, a ranking
officer retired under Louis XVIII., sold all his back pay to Gigonnet.
[The Vendetta.] Bidault was one of the syndicate that engineered the
bankruptcy of Birotteau in 1819. At this time he persecuted Mme.
Madou, a market dealer in filberts, who was his debtor. [Cesar
Birotteau.] In 1824 he succeeded in making his grand-nephew, Isidore
Baudoyer, chief of the division under the Minister of Finance; in this
he was aided by Gobseck and Mitral, and worked on the General
Secretary, Chardin des Lupeaulx, through the medium of the latter's
debts and the fact of his being candidate for deputy. [The Government
Clerks.] Bidault was shrewd enough; he saw through--and much to his
profit--the pretended speculation involved in the third receivership
which was operated by Nucingen in 1826. [The Firm of Nucingen.] In
1833 M. du Tillet advised Nathan, then financially stranded, to apply
to Gigonnet, the object being to involve Nathan. [A Daughter of Eve.]
The nick-name of Gigonnet was applied to Bidault on account of a
feverish, involuntary contraction of a leg muscle. [The Government
Clerks.]

BIDDIN, goldsmith, rue de l'Arbe-Sec, Paris, in 1829; one of Esther
Gobseck's creditors. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

BIFFE (La), concubine of the criminal Riganson, alias Le Biffon. This
woman, who was a sort of Jacques Collin in petticoats, evaded the
police, thanks to her disguises. She could ape the marquise, the
baronne and the comtesse to perfection. She had her own carriage and
footmen. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

BIFFON (Le), an alias of Riganson.

BIGORNEAU, sentimental clerk of Fritot's, the shawl merchant in the
Bourse quarter, Paris, time of Louis Philippe. [Gaudissart II.]

BIJOU (Olympe). (See Grenouville, Madame.)

BINET, inn-keeper in the Department of l'Orne in 1809. He was
concerned in a trial which created some stir, and cast a shadow over
Mme. de la Chanterie, striking at her daughter, Mme. des Tours-
Minieres. Binet harbored some brigands known as "chauffeurs." He was
brought to trial for it and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
[The Seamy Side of History.]

BIROTTEAU (Jacques), a gardener hard by Chinon. He married the
chambermaid of a lady on whose estate he trimmed vines. Three boys
were born to them: Francois, Jean and Cesar. He lost his wife on the
birth of the last child (1779), and himself died shortly after. [Cesar
Birotteau.]

BIROTTEAU (Abbe Francois), eldest son of Jacques Birotteau; born in
1766; vicar of the church of Saint-Gatien at Tours, and afterwards
cure of Saint-Symphorien in the same city. After the death of the Abbe
de la Berge, in 1817, he became confessor of Mme. de Mortsauf,
attending her last moments. [The Lily of the Valley.] His brother
Cesar, the perfumer, wrote him after his--Cesar's--business failure in
1819, asking aid. Abbe Birotteau, in a touching letter, responded with
the sum of one thousand francs which represented all his own little
hoard and, in addition, a loan obtained from Mme. de Listomere. [Cesar
Birotteau.] Accused of having inveigled Mme. de Listomere to leave him
the income of fifteen hundred francs, which she bequeathed him on her
death, Abbe Birotteau was placed under interdiction, in 1826, the
victim of the terrible hatred of the Abbe Troubert. [The Vicar of
Tours.]

BIROTTEAU (Jean), second son of Jacques Birotteau. A captain in the
army, killed in the historic battle of La Trebia which lasted three
days, June 17-19, 1799. [Cesar Birotteau.]

BIROTTEAU (Cesar), third son of Jacques Birotteau, born in 1779;
dealer in perfumes in Paris at number 397 rue Saint-Honore, near the
Place Vendome, in the old shop once occupied by the grocer Descoings,
who was executed with Andre Chenier in 1794. After the eighteenth
Brumaire, Cesar Birotteau succeeded Sieur Ragon, and moved the source
of the "Queen of Roses" to the above address. Among his customers were
the Georges, the La Billardieres, the Montaurans, the Bauvans, the
Longuys, the Mandas, the Berniers, the Guenics, and the Fontaines.
These relations with the militant Royalists implicated him in the plot
of the 13th Vendemaire, 1795, against the Convention; and he was
wounded, as he told over and over, "by Bonaparte on the borders of
Saint-Roche." In May, 1800, Birotteau the perfumer married Constance-
Barbe-Josephine Pillerault. By her he had an only daughter, Cesarine,
who married Anselme Popinot in 1822. Successively captain, then chief
of battalion in the National Guard and adjunct-mayor of the eleventh
arrondissement, Birotteau was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of
Honor in 1818. To celebrate his nomination in the Order, he gave a
grand ball* which, on account of the very radical changes necessitated
in his apartments, and coupled with some bad speculations, brought
about his total ruin; he filed a petition in bankruptcy the year
following. By stubborn effort and the most rigid economy, Birotteau
was able to indemnify his creditors completely, three years later
(1822). But he died soon after the formal court reinstating. He
numbered among his patrons in 1818 the following: the Duc and Duchesse
de Lenoncourt, the Princesse de Blamont-Chauvry, the Marquise
d'Espard, the two Vandenesses, Marsay, Ronquerolles, and the Marquis
d'Aiglemont. [Cesar Birotteau. A Bachelor's Establishment.] Cesar
Birotteau was likewise on friendly terms with the Guillaumes, clothing
dealers in the rue Saint-Denis. [At the Sign of the Cat and Racket.]

*   The 17th of December was really Thursday and not Sunday, as
    erroneously given.

BIROTTEAU (Madame), born Constance-Barbe-Josephine Pillerault in 1782.
Married Cesar Birotteau in May, 1800. Previous to her marriage she was
head "saleslady" at the "Little Sailor"* novelty shop, corner of Quai
Anjou and rue des Deux Ponts, Paris. Her surviving relative and
guardian was her uncle, Claude-Joseph Pillerault. [Cesar Birotteau.]

*   This shop still exists at the same place, No. 43 Quai d'Anjou and
    40 rue des Deux-Ponts, being run by M. L. Bellevaut.

BIROTTEAU (Cesarine). (See Popinot, Madame Anselme.)

BIXIOU,* Parisian grocer, in rue Saint-Honore, before the Revolution
in the eighteenth century. He had a clerk called Descoings, who
married his widow. The grocer Bixiou was the grandfather of Jean-
Jacques Bixiou, the celebrated cartoonist. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

*   Pronounced "Bissiou."

BIXIOU, son of the preceding and father of Jean-Jacques Bixiou. He was
a colonel of the Twenty-first Regiment; killed at the battle of
Dresden, on the 26th or 27th of August, 1813. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

BIXIOU (Jean-Jacques), famous artist; son of Colonel Bixiou who was
killed at Dresden; grandson of Mme. Descoings, whose first husband was
the grocer Bixiou. Born in 1797, he pursued a course of study at the
Lyceum, to which he had obtained a scholarship. He had for friends
Philippe and Joseph Bridau, and Master Desroches. Later he entered the
painter Gros's studio. Then in 1819, through the influence of the Ducs
de Maufrigneuse and de Rhetore, whom he met at some dancer's, he
obtained a position with the Minister of Finance. He remained with
this administration until December, 1824, when he resigned. In this
same year he was one of the best men for Philippe Bridau, who married
Flore Brazier, known as La Rabouilleuse, the widow of J.-J. Rouget.
After this woman's death, in 1828, he was led, disguised as a priest,
to the residence of the Soulanges, where he told the comte about the
scandal connected with her death, knowingly caused by her husband; he
told, also, about the bad habits and vulgarities of Philippe Bridau,
and thus caused the breaking off of the marriage of this weather-
beaten soldier with Mlle. Amelie de Soulanges. A talented cartoonist,
distinguished practical joker, and recognized as one of the kings of
/bon mot/, he led a free and easy life. He was on speaking terms with
all the artists and all the lorettes of his day. Among others he knew
the painter, Hippolyte Schinner. He turned a pretty penny, during the
trial of De Fualdes and de Castaing, by illustrating in a fantastic
way the account of this trial. [A Bachelor's Establishment. The
Government Clerks. The Purse.] He designed some vignettes for the
writing of Canalis. [Modeste Mignon.] With Blondet, Lousteau and
Nathan he was a habitue of the house of Esther Gobseck, rue Saint-
Georges, in 1829, 1830. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] In a private
room of a well-known restaurant, in 1836, he wittily related to Finot,
Blondet and Couture the source of Nucingen's fortune. [The Firm of
Nucingen.] In January, 1837, his friend Lousteau had him come
especially to upbraid him, Lousteau, on account of the latter's
irregular ways with Mme. de la Baudraye, while she, concealed in an
ante-room, heard it all. This scene had been arranged beforehand; its
object was to give Lousteau a chance to declare, apparently, his
unquenchable attachment for his mistress. [The Muse of the
Department.] In 1838 he attended the house-warming of Heloise
Brisetout in rue Chauchat. In the same year he was attendant at the
marriage of Steinbock with Hortense Hulot, and of Crevel with the
widow Marneffe. [Cousin Betty.] In 1839 the sculptor Dorlange-
Sallenauve knew of Bixiou and complained of his slanders. [The Member
for Arcis.] Mme. Schontz treated him most cordially in 1838, and he
had to pass for her "special," although their relations, in fact, did
not transcend the bounds of friendship. [Beatrix.] In 1840, at the
home of Marguerite Turquet, maintained by the notary Cardot, when
Lousteau, Nathan and La Palferine were also present, he heard a story
by Desroches. [A Man of Business.] About 1844, Bixiou helped in a high
comedy relative to a Selim shawl sold by Fritot to Mistress Noswell.
Bixiou himself had purchased, in a shop with M. du Ronceret, a shawl
for Mme. Schontz. [Gaudissart II.] In 1845 Bixiou showed Paris and the
"Unconscious Humorists" to a Pyrrenean named Gazonal, in company with
Leon de Lora, a cousin of the countryman. At this time Bixiou dwelt at
number 112 rue Richelieu, sixth floor; when he had a regular position
he had lived in rue de Ponthieu. [The Unconscious Humorists.] In the
rue Richelieu period he was the lover of Heloise Brisetout. [Cousin
Pons.]

BLAMONT-CHAUVRY (Princesse de), mother of Mme. d'Espard; aunt of the
Duchesse de Langeais; great aunt of Mme. de Mortsauf; a veritable
d'Hozier in petticoats. Her drawing-room set the fashion in Faubourg
Saint-Germain, and the sayings of this feminine Talleyrand were
listened to as oracles. Very aged at the beginning of the reign of
Louis XVIII., she was one of the most poetic relics of the reign of
Louis XV., the "Well-Beloved;" and to this nick-name--as the records
had it--she had contributed her full share. [The Thirteen.] Mme.
Firmiani was received by the princess on account of the Cadignans, to
whom she was related on her mother's side. [Madame Firmiani.] Felix de
Vandenesse was admitted to her "At Homes," on the recommendation of
Mme. de Mortsauf; nevertheless he found in this old lady a friend
whose affection had a quality almost maternal. The princess was in the
family conclave which met to consider an amorous escapade of the
Duchesse Antoinette de Langeais. [The Lily of the Valley. The
Thirteen.]

BLANDUREAUS (The), wealthy linen merchants at Alencon, time of the
Restoration. They had an only daughter, to whom the President du
Ronceret wished to marry his son. She, however, married Joseph
Blondet, the oldest son of Judge Blondet. This marriage caused secret
hostility between the two fathers, one being the other's superior in
office. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

BLONDET, judge at Alencon in 1824; born in 1758; father of Joseph and
Emile Blondet. At the time of the Revolution he was a public
prosecutor. A botanist of note, he had a remarkable conservatory where
he cultivated geraniums only. This conservatory was visited by the
Empress Marie-Louise, who spoke of it to the Emperor and obtained for
the judge the decoration of the Legion of Honor. Following the
Victurien d'Esgrignon episode, about 1825, Judge Blondet was made an
officer in the Order and chosen councillor at the Royal Court. Here he
remained in office no longer than absolutely necessary, retreating to
his dear Alencon home. He married in 1798, at the age of forty, a
young girl of eighteen, who in consequence of this disparity was
unfaithful to him. He knew that his second son, Emile, was not his
own; he therefore cared only for the elder and sent the younger
elsewhere as soon as possible. [Jealousies of a Country Town.] About
1838 Fabien du Ronceret obtained credit in an agricultural convention
for a flower which old Blondet had given him, but which he exhibited
as a product of his own green-house. [Beatrix.]

BLONDET (Madame), wife of the preceding; born in 1780; married in
1798. She was intimate with a prefect of Orne, who was the natural
father of Emile Blondet. Distant ties bound her to the Troisville
family, and it was to them that she sent Emile, her favored son.
Before her death, in 1818, she commended him to her old-time lover and
also to the future Madame de Montcornet, with whom he had been reared.
[Jealousies of a Country Town.]

BLONDET (Joseph), elder son of Judge Blondet of Alencon; born in that
city about 1799. In 1824 he practiced law and aspired to become a
substitute judge. Meanwhile he succeeded his father, whose post he
filled till his death. He was one of the numerous men of ordinary
talent. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

BLONDET (Madame Joseph), nee Claire Blandureau, wife of Joseph
Blondet, whom she married when he was appointed judge at Alencon. She
was the daughter of wealthy linen dealers in the city. [Jealousies of
a Country Town.]

BLONDET (Emile), born at Alencon about 1800; legally the younger son
of Judge Blondet, but really the son of a prefect of Orne. Tenderly
loved by his mother, but hated by Judge Blondet, who sent him, in
1818, to study law in Paris. Emile Blondet knew the noble family of
d'Esgrignon in Alencon, and for the youngest daughter of this
illustrious house he felt an esteem that was really admiration.
[Jealousies of a Country Town.] In 1821 Emile Blondet was a remarkably
handsome young fellow. He made his first appearance in the "Debats" by
a series of masterly articles which called forth from Lousteau the
remark that he was "one of the princes of criticism." [A Distinguished
Provincial at Paris.] In 1824 he contributed to a review edited by
Finot, where he collaborated with Lucien de Rubempre and where he was
allowed full swing by his chief. Emile Blondet had the most desultory
of habits; one day he would be a boon companion, without compunction,
with those destined for slaughter on the day following. He was always
"broke" financially. In 1829, 1830, Bixiou, Lousteau, Nathan and he
were frequenters of Esther's house, rue Saint-Georges. [Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.] A cynic was Blondet, with little regard for glory
undefiled. He won a wager that he could upset the poet Canalis, though
the latter was full of assurance. He did this by staring fixedly at
the poet's curls, his boots, or his coat-tails, while he recited
poetry or gesticulated with proper emphasis, fixed in a studied pose.
[Modeste Mignon.] He was acquainted with Mlle. des Touches, being
present at her home on one occasion, about 1830, when Henri de Marsay
told the story of his first love affair. He took part in the
conversation and depicted the "typical woman" to Comte Adam Laginski.
[Another Study of Woman.] In 1832 he was a guest at Mme. d'Espard's,
where he met his childish flame, Mme. de Montcornet, also the
Princesse de Cadignan, Lady Dudley, d'Arthez, Nathan, Rastignac, the
Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto, Maxime de Trailles, the Marquis d'Esgrignon,
the two Vandenesses, du Tillet, the Baron Nucingen and the Chevalier
d'Espard, brother-in-law of the marquise. [The Secrets of a Princess.]
About 1833 Blondet presented Nathan to Mme. de Montcornet, at whose
home the young Countess Felix de Vandenesse made the acquaintance of
the poet and was much smitten with him for some time. [A Daughter of
Eve.] In 1836 he and Finot and Couture chimed in on the narrative of
the rise of Nucingen, told with much zest by Bixiou in a private room
of a famous restaurant. [The Firm of Nucingen.] Eight or ten years
prior to February, 1848, Emile Blondet, on the brink of suicide,
witnessed an entire transition in his affairs. He was chosen a
prefect, and he married the wealthy widow of Comte de Montcornet, who
offered him her hand when she became free. They had known and loved
each other since childhood. [The Peasantry.]

BLONDET (Virginie), wife by second marriage of Emile Blondet; born in
1797; daughter of the Vicomte de Troisville; granddaughter of the
Russian Princesse Scherbelloff. She was brought up at Alencon, with
her future husband. In 1819 she married the General de Montcornet.
Twenty years later, a widow, she married the friend of her youth, who
this long time had been her lover. [Jealousies of a Country Town. The
Secrets of a Princess. The Peasantry.] She and Mme. d'Espard tried to
convert Lucien de Rubempre to the monarchical side in 1821. [A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] She was present at Mlle. des
Touches', about 1830, when Marsay told about his first love, and she
joined in the conversation. [Another Study of Woman.] She received a
rather mixed set, from an aristocratic standpoint, but here might be
found the stars of finance, art and literature. [The Member for
Arcis.] Mme. Felix de Vandenesse saw Nathan the poet for the first
time and noticed him particularly at Mme. de Montcornet's, in 1834,
1835. [A Daughter of Eve.] Mme. Emile Blondet, then Madame la Generale
de Montcornet, passed the summer and autumn of 1823 in Burgundy, at
her beautiful estate of Aigues, where she lived a burdened and
troubled life among the many and varied types of peasantry. Remarried,
and now the wife of a prefect, eight years or so before February,
1848, time of Louis Philippe, she visited her former properties. [The
Peasantry.]

BLUTEAU (Pierre), assumed name of Genestas. [The Country Doctor.]

BOCQUILLON, an acquaintance of Mme. Etienne Gruget. In 1820, rue des
Enfants-Rouges, Paris, she mistook for him the stock-broker, Jules
Desmarets, who was entering her door. [The Thirteen.]

BOGSECK (Madame van), name bestowed by Jacques Collin on Esther van
Gobseck when, in 1825, he gave her, transformed morally and
intellectually, to Lucien de Rubempre, in an elegant flat on rue
Taitbout. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

BOIROUGE, president of the Sancerre Court at the time when the Baronne
de la Baudraye held social sway over that city. Through his wife, he
was related to the Popinot-Chandiers, to Judge Popinot of Paris, and
to Anselme Popinot. He was hereditary owner of a house which he did
not need, and which he very gladly leased to the baronne for the
purpose of starting a literary society that, however, degenerated very
soon into an ordinary clique. Actuated by jealousy, President Boirouge
was one of the principals in the defeat of Procureur Clagny for
deputy. He was reputed to be unchaste at repartee. [The Muse of the
Department.]

BOIROUGE (Madame), nee Popinot-Chandier, wife of President Boirouge;
stood well among the middle-class of Sancerre. After having been
leader in the opposition to Mme. de la Baudraye for nine years, she
induced her son Gatien to attend the Baudraye receptions, persuading
herself that he would soon make his way. Profiting by the visit of
Bianchon to Sancerre, Mme. Boirouge obtained of the famous physician,
her relative, a gratuitous consultation by giving him full particulars
regarding some pretended nervous trouble of the stomach, in which
complaint he recognized a periodic dyspepsia. [The Muse of the
Department.]

BOIROUGE (Gatien), son of President Boirouge; born in 1814; the junior
"patito" of Mme. de la Baudraye, who employed him in all sorts of
small ways. Gatien Boirouge was made game of by Lousteau, to whom he
had confessed his love for that masterful woman. [The Muse of the
Department.]

BOISFRANC (De), procureur-general, then first president of a royal
court under the Restoration. (See Dubut.)

BOISFRANC (Dubut de), president of the Aides court under the old
regime; brother of Dubut de Boisfrelon and of Dubut de Boislaurier.
[The Seamy Side of History.]

BOISFRELON (Dubut de), brother of Dubut de Boisfranc and of Dubut de
Boislaurier; at one time councillor in Parliament; born in 1736; died
in 1832 in the home of his niece, the Baronne de la Chanterie.
Godefroid succeeded him. M. de Boisfrelon had been one of the
"Brotherhood of Consolation." He was married, but his wife probably
died before him. [The Seamy Side of History.]

BOISLAURIER (Dubut de), junior brother of Dubut de Boisfranc and of
Dubut de Boisfrelon. Commander-in-chief of the Western Rebellion in
1808-1809, and designated then by the surname of Augustus. With
Rifoel, Chevalier du Vissard, he plotted the organization of the
"Chauffeurs" of Mortagne. Then, in the trial of the "brigands," he was
condemned to death by default. [The Seamy Side of History.]

BOIS-LEVANT, chief of division under the Minister of Finance in 1824,
at the time when Xavier Rabourdin and Isidore Baudoyer contested the
succession of office in another division, that of F. de la
Billardiere. [The Government Clerks.]

BOLESLAS, Polish servant of the Comte and Comtesse Laginski, in rue de
la Pepiniere, Paris, between 1835 and 1842. [The Imaginary Mistress.]

BONAMY (Ida), aunt of Mlle. Antonia Chocardelle. At the time of Louis
Philippe, she conducted, on rue Coquenard (since 1848 rue Lamartine),
"just a step or two from rue Pigalle," a reading-room given to her
niece by Maxime de Trailles. [A Man of Business.]

BONAPARTE (Napoleon), Emperor of the French; born at Ajaccio, August
15, 1768, or 1769, according to varying accounts; died at St. Helena
May 5, 1821. As First Consul in 1800 he received at the Tuileries the
Corsican, Bartholomeo di Piombo, and disentangled his countryman from
the latter's implication in a vendetta. [The Vendetta.] On the evening
of the battle of Jena, October 13, 1806, he was met on that ground by
Laurence de Cinq-Cygne, who had come post haste from France, and to
whom he accorded pardon for the Simeuses and the Hauteserres,
compromised in the abduction of Senator Malin de Gondreville. [The
Gondreville Mystery.] Napoleon Bonaparte was strongly concerned in the
welfare of his lieutenant, Hyacinthe Chabert, during the battle of
Eylau. [Colonel Chabert.] In November, 1809, he was to have attended a
grand ball given by Senator Malin de Gondreville; but he was detained
at the Tuileries by a scene--noised abroad that same evening--between
Josephine and himself, a scene which disclosed their impending
divorce. [Peace in the House.] He condoned the infamous conduct of the
police officer Contenson. [The Seamy Side of History.] In April, 1813,
during a dress-parade on the Place du Carrousel, Paris, Napoleon
noticed Mlle. de Chatillonest, who had come with her father to see the
handsome Colonel d'Aiglemont, and leaning towards Duroc he made a
brief remark which made the Grand Marshal smile. [A Woman of Thirty.]

BONAPARTE (Lucien), brother of Napoleon Bonaparte; born in 1775; died
in 1840. In June, 1800, he went to the house of Talleyrand, the
Foreign Minister, and there announced to him and also to Fouche,
Sieyes and Carnot, the victory of his brother at Montebello. [The
Gondreville Mystery.] In the month of October of the same year he was
encountered by his countryman, Bartholomeo di Piombo, whom he
introduced to the First Consul; he also gave his purse to the Corsican
and afterwards contributed towards relieving his difficulties. [The
Vendetta.]

BONFALOT, or BONVALOT (Madame), an aged relative of F. du Bruel at
Paris. La Palferine first met Mme. du Bruel in 1834 on the boulevard,
and boldly followed her all the way to Mme. de Bonfalot's, where she
was calling. [A Prince of Bohemia.]

BONFONS (Cruchot de), nephew of Cruchot the notary and Abbe Cruchot;
born in 1786; president of the Court of First Instance of Saumur in
1819. The Cruchot trio backed by a goodly number of cousins and allied
to twenty families in the city, formed a party similar to that of the
olden-time Medicis at Florence; and also, like the Medicis, the
Cruchots had their Pazzis in the persons of the Grassins. The prize
contested for between the Cruchots and the Grassins was the hand of
the rich heiress, Eugenie Grandet. In 1827, after nine years of suing,
the President Cruchot de Bonfons married the young woman, now left an
orphan. Previous to this he had been commissioned by her to settle in
full, both principal and interest, with the creditors of Charles
Grandet's father. Six months after his marriage, Bonfons was elected
councillor to the Royal Court of Angers. Then after some years
signalized by devoted service he became first president. Finally
chosen deputy for Saumur in 1832, he died within a week, leaving his
widow in possession of an immense fortune, still further augmented by
the bequests of the Abbe and the notary Cruchot. Bonfons was the name
of an estate of the magistrate. He married Eugenie only through
cupidity. He looked like "a big, rusty nail." [Eugenie Grandet.]

BONFONS (Eugenie Cruchot de), only daughter of M. and Mme. Felix
Grandet; born at Saumur in 1796. Strictly reared by a mother gentle
and devout, and by a father hard and avaricious. The single bright ray
across her life was an absolutely platonic love for her cousin Charles
Grandet. But, once away from her, this young man was forgetful of her;
and, on his return from the Indies in 1827, a rich man, he married the
young daughter of a nobleman. Upon this occurrence, Eugenie Grandet,
now an orphan, settled in full with the creditors of Charles' father,
and then bestowed her hand upon the President Cruchot de Bonfons, who
had paid her court for nine years. At the age of thirty-six she was
left a widow without having ceased to be a virgin, following her
expressed wish. Sadly she secluded herself in the gloomy home of her
childhood at Saumur, where she devoted the rest of her life to works
of benevolence and charity. After her father's death, Eugenie was
often alluded to, by the Cruchot faction, as Mlle. de Froidfond, from
the name of one of her holdings. In 1832 an effort was made to induce
Mme. de Bonfons to wed with Marquis de Froidfond, a bankrupt widower
of fifty odd years and possessed of numerous progeny. [Eugenie
Grandet.]

BONGRAND, born in 1769; first an advocate at Melun, then justice of
the peace at Nemours from 1814 to 1837. He was a friend of Doctor
Mirouet's and helped educate Ursule Mirouet, protecting her to the
best of his ability after the death of the old physician, and aiding
in the restitution of her fortune which Minoret-Levrault had impaired
by the theft of the doctor's will. M. Bongrand had wanted to make a
match between Ursule Mirouet and his son, but she loved Savinien de
Portenduere. The justice of the peace became president of the court at
Melun, after the marriage of the young lady with Savinien. [Ursule
Mirouet.]

BONGRAND (Eugene), son of Bongrand the justice of the peace. He
studied law at Paris under Derville the attorney, this constituting
all his course. He became public prosecutor at Melun after the
Revolution of 1830, and general prosecutor in 1837. Failing in his
love suit with Ursule Mirouet, he probably married the daughter of M.
Levrault, former mayor of Nemours. [Ursule Mirouet.]

BONNAC, a rather handsome young fellow, who was head clerk for the
notary Lupin at Soulanges in 1823. His accomplishments were his only
dowry. He was loved in platonic fashion by his employer's wife, Mme.
Lupin, otherwise known as Bebelle, a fat ridiculous female without
education. [The Peasantry.]

BONNEBAULT, retired cavalry soldier, the Lovelace of the village of
Blangy, Burgundy, and its suburbs in 1823. Bonnebault was the lover of
Marie Tonsard who was perfectly foolish about him. He had still other
"good friends" and lived at their expense. Their generosity did not
suffice for his dissipations, his cafe bills and his unbridled taste
for billiards. He dreamed of marrying Aglae Socquard, only daughter of
Pere Socquard, proprietor of the "Cafe de la Paix" at Soulanges.
Bonnebault obtained three thousand francs from General de Montcornet
by coming to him to confess voluntarily that he had been commissioned
to kill him for this price. The revelation, with other things, lead
the general to weary of his fierce struggle with the peasantry, and to
put up for sale his property at Aigues, which became the prey of
Gaubertin, Rigou and Soudry. Bonnebault was squint-eyed and his
physical appearance did not belie his depravity. [The Peasantry.]

BONNEBAULT (Mere), grandmother of Bonnebault the veteran. In 1823, at
Conches, Burgandy, where she lived, she owned a cow which she did not
hesitate to pasture in the fields belonging to General de Montcornet.
The numerous depredations of the old woman, added to convictions for
many similar offences, caused the general to decide to confiscate the
cow. [The Peasantry.]

BONNET (Abbe), Cure of Montegnac near Limoges from 1814 on. In this
capacity, he assisted at the public confession of his penitent, Mme.
Graslin, in the summer of 1844. Upon leaving the seminary of Saint-
Sulpice, Paris, he was sent to this village of Montegnac, which he
never after wished to leave. Here, sometimes unaided, sometimes with
the help of Mme. Graslin, he toiled for a material and moral
betterment, bringing about an entire regeneration of a wretched
country. It was he who brought the outlawed Tascheron back into the
Church, and who accompanied him to the very foot of the scaffold, with
a devotion which caused his own very sensitive nature much cringing.
Born in 1788, he had embraced the ecclesiastical calling through
choice, and all his studies had been to that end. He belonged to a
family of more than easy circumstancaes. His father was a self-made
man, stern and unyielding. Abbe Bonnet had an older brother, and a
sister whom he counseled with his mother to marry as soon as possible,
in order to release the young woman from the terrible paternal yoke.
[The Country Parson.]

BONNET, older brother of Abbe Bonnet, who enlisted as a private about
the beginning of the Empire. He became a general in 1813; fell at
Leipsic. [The Country Parson.]

BONNET (Germain), /valet de chambre/ of Canalis in 1829, at the time
when the poet went to Havre to contest the hand of Modeste Mignon. A
servant full of /finesse/ and irreproachable in appearance, he was of
the greatest service to his master. He courted Philoxene Jacmin,
chambermaid of Mme. de Chaulieu. Here the pantry imitated the parlor,
for the academician's mistress was the great lady herself. [Modest
Mignon.]

BONTEMS, a country landowner in the neighborhood of Bayeux, who
feathered his nest well during the Revolution, by purchasing
government confiscations at his own terms. He was pronounced "red
cap," and became president of his district. His daughter, Angelique
Bontems, married Granville during the Empire; but at this time Bontems
was dead. [A Second Home.]

BONTEMS (Madame), wife of the preceding; outwardly pious, inwardly
vain; mother of Angelique Bontems, whom she had reared in much the
same attitude, and whose marriage with a Granville was, in
consequence, so unhappy. [A Second Home.]

BONTEMS (Angelique). (See Granville, Madame de.)

BORAIN (Mademoiselle), the most stylish costumer in Provins, at the
time of Charles X. She was commissioned by the Rogrons to make a
complete wardrobe for Pierrette Lorrain, when that young girl was sent
them from Brittany. [Pierrette.]

BORDEVIN (Madame), Parisian butcher in rue Charlot, at the time when
Sylvain Pons dwelt hard by in rue de Normandie. Mme. Bordevin was
related to Mme. Sabatier. [Cousin Pons.]

BORDIN, procureur at the Chatelet before the Revolution; then advocate
of the Court of First Instance of the Seine, under the Empire. In 1798
he instructed and advised with M. Alain, a creditor of Monegod's. Both
had been clerks at the procureur's. In 1806, the Marquis de
Chargeboeuf went to Paris to hunt for Master Bordin, who defended the
Simeuses before the Criminal Court of Troyes in the trial regarding
the abduction and sequestration of Senator Malin. In 1809 he also
defended Henriette Bryond des Tours-Minieres, nee La Chanterie, in the
trial docketed as the "Chauffeurs of Mortagne." [The Gondreville
Mystery. The Seamy Side of History.] In 1816 Bordin was consulted by
Mme. d'Espard regarding her husband. [The Commission in Lunacy.]
During the Restoration a banker at Alencon made quarterly payments of
one hundred and fifty livres to the Chevalier de Valois through the
Parisian medium of Bordin. [Jealousies of a Country Town.] For ten
years Bordin represented the nobility. Derville succeeded him. [The
Gondreville Mystery.]

BORDIN (Jerome-Sebastien), was also procureur at the Chatelet, and, in
1806, advocate of the Seine Court. He succeeded Master Guerbet, and
sold his practice to Sauvagnest, who disposed of it to Desroches. [A
Start in Life.]

BORN (Comte de), brother of the Vicomtesse de Grandlieu. In the winter
of 1829-1830, he is discovered at the home of his sister, taking part
in a conversation in which the advocate Derville related the marital
infelicities of M. de Restaud, and the story of his will and his
death. The Comte de Born seized the chance to exploit the character of
Maxime de Trailles, the lover of Mme. de Restaud. [Gobseck.]

BORNICHE, son-in-law of M. Hochon, the old miser of Issoudun. He died
of chagrin at business failures, and at not having received any
assistance from his father or mother. His wife preceded him but a
short time to the tomb. They left a son and a daughter, Baruch and
Adolphine, who were brought up by their maternal grandfather, with
Francois Hochon, another grandchild of the goodman's. Borniche was
probably a Calvinist. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

BORNICHE (Monsieur and Madame), father and mother of the preceding.
They were still living in 1823, when their son and their daughter-in-
law had been deceased some time. In April of this year, old Mme.
Borniche and her friend Mme. Hochon, who ruled socially in Issoudun,
assisted at the wedding of La Rabouilleuse with Jean-Jacques Rouget.
[A Bachelor's Establishment.]

BORNICHE (Baruch), grandson of the preceding, and of M. and Mme.
Hochon. Born in 1800. Early left an orphan, he and his sister were
reared by his grandfather on the maternal side. He had been one of the
accomplices of Maxence Gilet, and took part in the nocturnal raids of
the "Knights of Idlesse." When his conduct became known to his
grandfather, in 1822, the latter lost no time in removing him from
Issoudun, sending him to Monegod's office, Paris, to study law. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

BORNICHE (Adolphine), sister of Baruch Borniche; born in 1804. Brought
up almost a recluse in the frigid, dreary house of her grandfather,
Hochon, she spent most of her time peering through the windows, in the
hope of discovering some of the terrible things which--as Dame Rumor
had it--occurred in the home of Jean-Jacques Rouget, next door. She
likewise awaited with some impatience the arrival of Joseph Bridau in
Issoudun, wishing to inspire some sentiment in him, and taking the
liveliest interest in the painter, on account of the monstrosities
which were attributed to him because of his being an artist. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

BOUCARD, head-clerk of the attorney Derville in 1818, at the time when
Colonel Chabert sought to recover his rights with his wife who had
been remarried to Comte Ferraud. [Colonel Chabert.]

BOUCHER, Besancon merchant in 1834, who was the first client of Albert
Savarus in that city. He assumed financial control of the "Revue de
l'Est," founded by the lawyer. M. Boucher was related by marriage to
one of the ablest editors of great theological works. [Albert
Savarus.]

BOUCHER (Alfred), eldest son of the preceding. Born in 1812. A youth,
eager for literary fame, whom Albert Savarus put on the staff of his
"Revue de l'Est," giving him his themes and subjects. Alfred Boucher
conceived a strong admiration for the managing editor, who treated him
as a friend. The first number of the "Revue" contained a "Meditation"
by Alfred. This Alfred Boucher believed he was exploiting Savarus,
whereas the contrary was the case. [Albert Savarus.]

BOUFFE (Marie), alias Vignol, actor born in Paris, September 4, 1800.
He appeared about 1822 at the Panorama-Dramatique theatre, on the
Boulevard du Temple, Paris, playing the part of the Alcade in a three-
act imbroglio by Raoul Nathan and Du Bruel entitled "L'Alcade dans
l'embarras." At the first night performance he announced that the
authors were Raoul and Cursy. Although very young at the time, this
artist made his first great success in this role, and revealed his
talent for depicting an old man. The critique of Lucien de Rubempre
established his position. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

BOUGIVAL (La). (See Cabirolle, Madame.)

BOUGNIOL (Mesdemoiselles), proprietors of an inn at Guerande (Loire-
Inferieure), at the time of Louis Philippe. They had as guests some
artist friends of Felicite des Touches--Camille Maupin--who had come
from Paris to see her. [Beatrix.]

BOURBONNE (De), wealthy resident of Tours, time of Louis XVIII. and
Charles X. An uncle of Octave de Camps. In 1824 he visited Paris to
ascertain the cause of the ruin of his nephew and sole heir, which
ruin was generally credited to dissipations with Mme. Firmiani. M. de
Bourbonne, a retired musketeer in easy circumstances, was well
connected. He had entry into the Faubourg Saint-Germain through the
Listomeres, the Lenoncourts and the Vandenesses. He caused himself to
be presented at Mme. Firmiani's as M. de Rouxellay, the name of his
estate. The advice of Bourbonne, which was marked by much
perspicacity, if followed, would have extricated Francois Birotteau
from Troubert's clutches; for the uncle of M. de Camps fathomed the
plottings of the future Bishop of Troyes. Bourbonne saw a great deal
more than did the Listomeres of Tours. [Madame Firmiani. The Vicar of
Tours.]

BOURDET (Benjamin), old soldier of the Empire, formerly serving under
Philippe Bridau's command. He lived quietly in the suburbs of Vatan,
in touch with Fario. In 1822 he placed himself at the entire disposal
of the Spaniard, and also of the officer who previously had put him
under obligations. Secretly he served them in their hatred of and
plots against Maxence Gilet. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

BOURGEAT, foundling of Saint-Flour. Parisian water-carrier about the
end of the eighteenth century. The friend and protector of the young
Desplein, the future famous surgeon. He lived in rue Quatre-Vents in
an humble house rendered doubly famous by the sojourn of Desplein and
by that of Daniel d'Arthez. A fervent Churchman of unswerving faith.
The future famous savant (Desplein) watched by his bedside at the last
and closed his eyes. [The Atheist's Mass.]

BOURGET, uncle of the Chaussard brothers. An old man who became
implicated in the trial of the Chauffeurs of Mortagne in 1809. He died
during the taking of the testimony, while making some confessions. His
wife, also apprehended, appeared before the court and was sentenced to
twenty-two years' imprisonment. [The Seamy Side of History.]

BOURGNEUFS (The), a family ruined by the De Camps and living in
poverty and seclusion at Saint-Germain en Laye, during the early part
of the nineteenth centruy. This family consisted of: the aged father,
who ran a lottery-office; the mother, almost always sick; and two
delightful daughters, who took care of the home and attended to the
correspondence. The Bourgneufs were rescued from their troubles by
Octave de Camps who, prompted by Mme. Firmiani, and at the cost of his
entire property, restored to them the fortune made away with by his
father. [Madame Firmiani.]

BOURGNIER (Du). (See Bousquier, Du.)

BOURIGNARD (Gratien-Henri-Victor-Jean-Joseph), father of Mme. Jules
Desmarets. One of the "Thirteen" and the former chief of the Order of
the Devorants under the title of Ferragus XXIII. He had been a
laborer, but afterwards was a contractor of buildings. His daughter
was born to an abandoned woman. About 1807 he was sentenced to twenty
years of hard labor, but he managed to escape during a journey of the
chain-gang from Paris to Toulon, and he returned to Paris. In 1820 he
lived there under diverse names and disguises, lodging successively on
rue des Vieux Augustins (now rue d'Argout), corner of rue Soly (an
insignificant street which disappeared when the Hotel des Postes was
rebuilt); then at number seven rue Joquelet; finally at Mme. E.
Gruget's, number twelve rue des Enfants-Rouges (now part of the rue
des Archives running from rue Pastourelle to rue Portefoin), changing
lodgings at this time to evade the investigations of Auguste de
Maulincour. Stunned by the death of his daughter, whom he adored and
with whom he held secret interviews to prevent her becoming amenable
to the law, he passed his last days in an indifferent, almost idiotic
way, idly watching match games at bowling on the Place de
l'Observatoire; the ground between the Luxembourg and the Boulevard de
Montparnasse was the scene of these games. One of the assumed names of
Bourignard was the Comte de Funcal. In 1815, Bourignard, alias
Ferragus, assisted Henri de Marsay, another member of the "Thirteen,"
in his raid on Hotel San-Real, where dwelt Paquita Valdes. [The
Thirteen.]

BOURLAC (Bernard-Jean-Baptiste-Macloud, Baron de), former procureur-
general of the Royal Court of Rouen, grand officer of the Legion of
Honor. Born in 1771. He fell in love with and married the daughter of
the Pole, Tarlowski, a colonel in the French Imperial Guard. By her he
had a daughter, Vanda, who became the Baronne de Mergi. A widower and
reserved by nature, he came to Paris in 1829 to take care of Vanda,
who was seized by a strange and very dangerous malady. After having
lived in the Quartier du Roule in 1838, with his daughter and
grandson, he dwelt for several years, in very straitened
circumstances, in a tumble-down house on the Boulevard du
Montparnasse, where Godefroid, a recent initiate into the "Brotherhood
of the Consolation" and under the direction of Mme. de la Chanterie
and her associates, came to his relief. Afterwards it was discovered
that the Baron de Bourlac was none other than the terrible magistrate
who had pronounced judgment on this noble woman and her daughter
during the trial of the Chauffeurs of Mortagne in 1809. Nevertheless,
the aiding of the family was not abated in the least. Vanda was cured,
thanks to a foreign physician, Halpersohn, procured by Godefroid. M.
de Bourlac was enabled to publish his great work on the "Spirit of
Modern Law." At Sorbonne a chair of comparative legislation was
created for him. At last he obtained forgiveness from Mme. de la
Chanterie, at whose feet he flung himself. [The Seamy Side of
History.] In 1817 the Baron de Bourlac, then procureur-general, and
superior of Soudry the younger, royal procureur, helped, with the
assistance also of the latter, to secure for Sibilet the position of
estate-keeper to the General de Montcornet at Aigues. [The Peasantry.]

BOURNIER, natural son of Gaubertin and of Mme. Socquard, the wife of
the cafe manager of Soulanges. His existence was unknown to Mme.
Gaubertin. He was sent to Paris where, under Leclercq, he learned the
printer's trade and finally became a foreman. Gaubertin then brought
him to Ville-aux-Fayes where he established a printing office and a
paper known as "Le Courrier de l'Avonne", entirely devoted to the
interests of the triumvirate, Rigou, Gaubertin and Soudry. [The
Peasantry.]

BOSQUIER (Du), or Croisier (Du), or Bourguier (Du), a descendant of an
old Alencon family. Born about 1760. He had been commissary agent in
the army from 1793 to 1799; had done business with Ouvrard, and kept a
running account with Barras, Bernadotte and Fouche. He was at that
time one of the great folk of finance. Discharged by Bonaparte in
1800, he withdrew to his natal town. After selling the Beauseant
house, which he owned, for the benefit of his creditors, he had
remaining an income of not more than twelve hundred francs. About 1816
he married Mlle. Cormon, a spinster who had been courted also by the
Chevalier de Valois and Athanase Granson. This marriage set him on his
feet again financially. He took the lead in the party of the
opposition, established a Liberal paper called "Le Courrier de
l'Orne," and was elected Receiver-General of the Exchequer, after the
Revolution of 1830. He waged bitter war on the white flag Royalists,
his hatred of them causing him secretly to condone the excesses of
Victurnien d'Esgrignon, until the latter involved him in an affair,
when Bousquier had him arrested, thinking thus to dispose of him
summarily. The affair was smoothed over only by tremendous pressure.
But the young nobleman provoked Du Bousquier into a duel where the
latter dangerously wounded him. Afterwards Bousquier gave him in
marriage the hand of his niece, Mlle. Duval, dowered with three
millions. [Jealousies of a Country Town.] Probably he was the father
of Flavie Minoret, the daughter of a celebrated Opera danseuse. But he
never acknowledged this child, and she was dowered by Princesse
Galathionne and married Colleville. [The Middle Classes.]

BOSQUIER (Madame du), born Cormon (Rose-Marie-Victoire) in 1773. She
was a very wealthy heiress, living with her maternal uncle, the Abbe
de Sponde, in an old house of Alencon (rue du Val-Noble), and
receiving, in 1816, the aristocracy of the town, with which she was
related through marriage. Courted simultaneously by Athanase Granson,
the Chevalier de Valois and Du Bousquier, she gave her hand to the old
commissariat, whose athletic figure and /passe/ libertinism had
impressed her vaguely. But her secret desires were utterly dashed by
him; she confessed later that she couldn't endure the idea of dying a
maid. Mme. du Bousquier was very devout. She was descended from the
stewards of the ancient Ducs d'Alencon. In this same year of 1816, she
hoped in vain to wed a Troisville, but he was already married. She
found it difficult to brook the state of hostility declared between M.
du Bousquier and the Esgrignons. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

BOUTIN, at one time sergeant in the cavalry regiment of which Chabert
was colonel. He lived at Stuttgart in 1814, exhibiting white bears
very well trained by him. In this city he encountered his former
ranking officer, shorn of all his possessions, and just emerging from
an insane asylum. Boutin aided him as best he could and took it upon
himself to go to Paris and inform Mme. Chabert of her husband's
whereabouts. But Boutin fell on the field of Waterloo, and could
hardly have accomplished his mission. [Colonel Chabert.]

BOUVARD (Doctor), physician of Paris, born about 1758. A friend of Dr.
Minoret, with whom he had some lively tilts about Mesmer. He had
adopted that system, while Minoret gainsaid the truth thereof. These
discussions ended in an estrangement, for some time, between the two
cronies. Finally, in 1829, Bouvard wrote Minoret asking him to come to
Paris to assist in some conclusive tests of magnetism. As a result of
these tests, Dr. Minoret, materialist and atheist that he was, became
a devout Spiritualist and Catholic. In 1829 Dr. Bouvard lived on rue
Ferou. [Ursule Mirouet.] He had been as a father to Dr. Lebrun,
physician of the Conciergerie in 1830, who, according to his own
avowal, owed to him his position, since he often drew from his master
his own ideas regarding nervous energy. [Scenes from a Courtesan's
Life.]

BOUYONNET, a lawyer at Mantes, under Louis Philippe, who, urged by his
confreres and stimulated by the public prosecutor, "showed up"
Fraisier, another lawyer in the town, who had been retained in a suit
for both parties at once. The result of this denunciation was to make
Fraisier sell his office and leave Mantes. [Cousin Pons.]

BRAMBOURG (Comte de), title of Philippe Bridau to which his brother
Joseph succeeded. [A Bachelor's Establishment. The Unconscious
Humorists.]

BRANDON (Lady Marie-Augusta), mother of Louis and Marie Gaston,
children born out of wedlock. Together with the Vicomtesse de
Beauseant she assisted, in company with Colonel Franchessini, probably
her lover, at the famous ball on the morning following which the duped
mistress of D'Ajuda-Pinto secretly left Paris. [The Member for Arcis.]
In 1820, while living with her two children in seclusion at La
Grenadiere, in the neighborhood of Tours, she saw Felix de Vandenesse,
at the time when Mme. de Mortsauf died, and charged him with a
pressing message to Lady Arabelle Dudley. [The Lily of the Valley.]
She died, aged thirty-six, during the Restoration, in the house at La
Grenadiere, and was buried in the Saint-Cyr Cemetery. Her husband,
Lord Brandon, who had abandoned her, lived in London, Brandon Square,
Hyde Park, at this time. In Touraine Lady Brandon was known only by
the assumed name of Mme. Willemsens. [La Grenadiere.]

BRASCHON, upholsterer and cabinet-maker in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine,
famous under the Restoration. He did a considerable amount of work for
Cesar Birotteau and figured among the creditors in his bankruptcy.
[Cesar Birotteau. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

BRAULARD, born in 1782. The head /claquer/ at the theatre of the
Panorama-Dramatique, and then at the Gymnase, about 1822. The lover of
Mlle. Millot. At this time he lived in rue Faubourg du Temple, in a
rather comfortable flat where he gave fine dinners to actresses,
managing editors and authors--among others, Adele Dupuis, Finot,
Ducange and Frederic du Petit-Mere. He was credited with having gained
an income of twenty thousand francs by discounting authors' and other
complimentary tickets. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] When
chief /claquer/, about 1843, he had in his following Chardin, alias
Idamore [Cousin Betty], and commanded his "Romans" at the Boulevard
theatre, which presented operas, spectaculars and ballets at popular
prices, and was run by Felix Gaudissart. [Cousin Pons.]

BRAZIER, this family included the following: A peasant of Vatan
(Indre), the paternal uncle and guardian of Mlle. Flore Brazier, known
as "La Rabouilleuse." In 1799 he placed her in the house of Dr. Rouget
on very satisfactory conditions for himself, Brazier. Rendered
comparatively rich by the doctor, he died two years before the latter,
in 1805, from a fall received on leaving an inn where he spent his
time after becoming well-to-do. His wife, who was a very harsh aunt of
Flore's. Lastly the brother and brother-in-law of this girl's
guardians, the real father of "La Rabouilleuse," who died in 1799, a
demented widower, in the hospital of Bourges. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

BRAZIER (Flore). (See Bridau, Madame Philippe.)

BREAUTEY (Comtesse de), a venerable woman of Provins, who maintained
the only aristocratic salon in that city, in 1827-1828. [Pierrette.]

BREBIAN (Alexandre de), member of the Angouleme aristocracy in 1821.
He frequented the Bargeton receptions. An artist like his friend
Bartas, he also was daft over drawing and would ruin every album in
the department with his grotesque productions. He posed as Mme. de
Bartas' lover, since Bartas paid court to Mme. de Brebian. [Lost
Illusions.]

BREBIAN (Charlotte de), wife of the preceding. Currently called
"Lolotte." [Lost Illusions.]

BREINTMAYER, a banking house of Strasbourg, entrusted by Michu in 1803
with the transmission of funds to the De Simeuses, young officers of
the army of Conde. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

BREZACS (The), Auvergnats, dealers in general merchandise and the
furnishings of chateaux during the Revolution, the Empire and the
Restoration. They had business dealings with Pierre Graslin, Jean-
Baptiste Sauviat and Martin Falleix. [The Country Parson. The
Government Clerks.]

BRIDAU, father of Philippe and Joseph Bridau; one of the secretaries
of Roland, Minister of the Interior in 1792, and the right arm of
succeeding ministers. He was attached fanatically to Napoleon, who
could appreciate him, and who made him chief of division in 1804. He
died in 1808, at the moment when he had been promised the offices of
director general and councillor of state with the title of comte. He
first met Agathe Rouget, whom he made his wife, at the home of the
grocer Descoings, the man whom he tried to save from the scaffold. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

BRIDAU (Agathe Rouget, Madame), wife of the preceding; born in 1773.
Legal daughter of Dr. Rouget of Issoudun, but possibly the natural
daughter of Sub-delegate Lousteau. The doctor did not waste any
affection upon her, and lost no time in sending her to Paris, where
she was reared by her uncle, the grocer Descoings. She died at the
close of 1828. Of her two sons, Philippe and Joseph, Mme. Bridau
always preferred the elder, though he caused her nothing but grief. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

BRIDAU (Philippe), elder son of Bridau and Agathe Rouget. Born in
1796. Placed in the Saint-Cyr school in 1813, he remained but six
months, leaving it to become under-lieutenant of the cavalry. On
account of a skirmish of the advance guard he was made full
lieutenant, during the French campaign, then captain after the battle
of La Fere-Champenoise, where Napoleon made him artillery officer. He
was decorated at Montereau. After witnessing the farewell at
Fontainebleu, he came back to his mother in July, 1814, being then
hardly nineteen. He did not wish to serve the Bourbons. In March,
1815, Philippe Bridau rejoined the Emperor at Lyons, accompanying him
to the Tuileries. He was promised a captaincy in a squadron of
dragoons of the Guard, and made officer of the Legion of Honor at
Waterloo. Reduced to half-pay, during the Restoration, he nevertheless
preserved his rank and officer's cross. He rejoined General Lallemand
in Texas, returning from America in October, 1819, thoroughly
degenerated. He ran an opposition newspaper in Paris in 1820-1821. He
led a most dissolute life; was the lover of Mariette Godeschal; and
attended all the parties of Tullia, Florentine, Florine, Coralie,
Matifat and Camusot. Not content with using the income of his brother
Joseph, he stole a coffer entrusted to him, and despoiled of her last
savings Mme. Descoings, who died of grief. Involved in a military plot
in 1822, he was sent to Issoudun, under the surveillance of the
police. There he created a disturbance in the "bachelor's
establishment" of his uncle, Jean-Jacques Rouget; killed in a duel
Maxence Gilet, the lover of Flore Brazier; brought about the girl's
marriage with his uncle; and married her himself when she became a
widow in 1824. When Charles X. succeeded to the throne, Philippe
Bridau re-entered the army as lieutenant-colonel of the Duc de
Maufrigneuse's regiment. In 1827 he passed with this grade into a
regiment of cavalry of the Royal Guard, and was made Comte de
Brambourg from the name of an estate which he had purchased. He was
promised further the office of commander in the Legion of Honor, as
well as in the Order of Saint-Louis. After having consciously caused
the death of his wife, Flore Brazier, he tried to marry Amelie de
Soulanges, who belonged to a great family. But his manoeuvres were
frustrated by Bixiou. The Revolution of 1830 resulted in the loss to
Philippe Bridau of a portion of the fortune which he had obtained from
his uncle by his marriage. Once more he entered military service,
under the July Government, which made him a colonel. In 1839 he fell
in an engagement with the Arabs in Africa. [A Bachelor's
Establishment. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

BRIDAU (Joseph), painter; younger brother of Philippe Bridau; born in
1799. He studied with Gros, and made his first exhibit at the Salon of
1823. He received great stimulus from his fellow-members of the
"Cenacle," in rue Quatre-Vents, also from his master, from Gerard and
from Mlle. des Touches. Moreover he was a hard-worker and an artist of
genius. He was decorated in 1827, and about 1839, through the interest
of the Comte de Serizy, for whose home he had formerly done some work,
he married the only daughter of a retired farmer, now a millionaire.
On the death of his brother Philippe, he inherited his house in rue de
Berlin, his estate of Brambourg, and his title of comte. [A Bachelor's
Establishment. A Distinguished Provincial at Paris. A Start in Life.]
Joseph Bridau made some vignettes for the works of Canalis. [Modeste
Mignon.] He was intimate with Hippolyte Schinner, whom he had known at
Gros' studio. [The Purse.] Shortly after 1830, he was present at an
"at home" at Mlle. des Touches, when Henri de Marsay told about his
first love affair. [Another Study of Woman.] In 1832 he rushed in to
see Pierre Grassou, borrowed five hundred francs of him, and told him
to "cater to his talent" and even to plunge into literature since he
was nothing more than a poor painter. At this same time, Joseph Bridau
painted the dining-hall in the D'Arthez chateau. [Pierre Grassou.] He
was a friend of Marie Gaston, and was attendant at his marriage with
Louise de Chaulieu, widow of Macumer, in 1833. [Letters of Two
Brides.] He also assisted at the wedding of Steinbock with Hortense
Hulot, and in 1838, at the instigation of Stidmann, clubbed in with
Leon de Lora to raise four thousand francs for the Pole, who was
imprisoned for debt. He had made the portrait of Josepha Mirah.
[Cousin Betty.] In 1839, at Mme. Montcornet's, Joseph Bridau praised
the talent and character displayed by Dorlange, the sculptor. [The
Member for Arcis.]

BRIDAU (Flore Brazier, Madame Philippe), born in 1787 at Vatan Indre,
known as "La Rabouilleuse," on account of her uncle having put her to
work, when a child, at stirring up (to "rabouiller") the streamlets,
so that he might find crayfishes. She was noticed on account of her
great beauty by Dr. Rouget of Issoudun, and taken to his home in 1799.
Jean-Jacques Rouget, the doctor's son become much enamored of her, but
obtained favor only through his money. On her part she was smitten
with Maxence Gilet, whom she entertained in the house of the old
bachelor at the latter's expense. But everything was changed by the
arrival of Philippe Bridau at Issoudun. Gilet was killed in a duel,
and Rouget married La Rabouilleuse in 1823. Left a widow soon after,
she married the soldier. She died in Paris in 1828, abandoned by her
husband, in the greatest distress, a prey to innumerable terrible
complaints, the products of the dissolute life into which Philippe
Bridau had designedly thrown her. She dwelt then on rue du Houssay, on
the fifth floor. She left here for the Dubois Hospital in Faubourg
Saint-Denis. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

BRIDAU (Madame Joseph), only daughter of Leger, an old farmer,
afterwards a multi-millionaire at Beaumont-sur-Oise; married to the
painter Joseph Bridau about 1839. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

BRIGAUT (Major), of Pen-Hoel, Vendee; retired major of the Catholic
Army which contested with the French Republic. A man of iron, but
devout and entirely unselfish. He had served under Charette, Mercier,
the Baron du Guenic and the Marquis de Montauran. He died in 1819, six
months after Mme. Lorrain, the widow of a major in the Imperial Army,
whom he was said to have consoled on the loss of her husband. Major
Brigaut had received twenty-seven wounds. [Pierrette. The Chouans.]

BRIGAUT (Jacques), son of Major Brigaut; born about 1811. Childhood
companion of Pierrette Lorrain, whom he loved in innocent fashion
similar to that of Paul and Virginia, and whose love was reciprocated
in the same way. When Pierrette was sent to Provins, to the home of
the Rogrons, her relatives, Jacques also went to this town and worked
at the carpenter's trade. He was present at the death-bed of the young
girl and immediately thereafter enlisted as a soldier; he became head
of a battalion, after having several times sought death vainly.
[Pierrette.]

BRIGITTE. (See Cottin, Madame.)

BRIGITTE, servant of Chesnel from 1795 on. In 1824 she was still with
him in rue du Bercail, Alencon, at the time of the pranks of the young
D'Esgrignon. Brigette humored the gormandizing of her master, the only
weakness of the goodman. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

BRIGNOLET, clerk with lawyer Bordin in 1806. [A Start in Life.]

BRISETOUT (Heloise), mistress of Celestin Crevel in 1838, at the time
when he was elected mayor. She succeeded Josepha Mirah, in a little

Lorette. [Cousin Betty.] In 1844-1845 she was /premiere danseuse/ in
the Theatre du Boulevard, when she was claimed by both Bixiou and
Gaudissart, her manager. She was a very literary young woman, much
spoken of in Bohemian circles for elegance and graciousness. She knew
all the great artists, and favored her kinsman, the musician
Garangeot. [Cousin Pons.] Towards the end of the reign of Louis
Philippe, she had Isidore Baudoyer for a "protector"; he was then
mayor of the arrondissement of Paris, which included the Palais
Royale. [The Middle Classes.]

BRISSET, a celebrated physician of Paris, time of Louis Philippe. a

chores for Moreau, manager of Presles, the estate of the Comte de
Serizy. [A Start in Life.]

BROSSARD (Madame), widow received at Mme. de Bargeton's at Angouleme
in 1821. Poor but well-born, she sought to marry her daughter, and in
the end, despite her precise dignity and "sour-sweetness," she got
along fairly well with the other sex. [Lost Illusions.]

BROSSARD (Camille du), daughter of the preceding. born in 1794. Fleshy
and imposing. Posed as a good pianist. Not yet married at twenty-
seven. [Lost Illusions.]

BROSSETTE (Abbe), born about 1790; cure of Blangy, Burgundy, in 1823,
at the time when General de Montcornet was struggling with the
peasantry. The abbe himself was an object of their defiance and
hatred. He was the fourth son of a good bourgeoisie family of Autun, a
faithful prelate, an obstinate Royalist and a man of intelligence.
[The Peasantry.] In 1840 he became a cure at Paris, in the faubourg
Saint-Germain, and at the request of Mme. de Grandlieu, he interested
himself in removing Calyste du Guenic from the clutches of Mme. de
Rochefide and restoring him to his wife. [Beatrix.]

BROUET (Joseph), a Chouan who died of wounds received in the fight of
La Pelerine or at the siege of Fougeres, in 1799. [The Chouans.]

Mortagne" in 1809. Condemned to death for contumacy. [The Seamy Side
of History.]

BRUEL (Du), chief of division to the Ministers of the Interior, under
the Empire. A friend of Bridau senior, retired on the advent of
Restoration. He was on very friendly terms with the widow Bridau,
coming each evening for a game of cards at her house, on rue Mazarine,
with his old-time colleagues, Claparon and Desroches. These three old
employes were called the "Three Sages of Greece" by Mmes. Bridau and
Descoings. M. du Bruel was descended of a contractor ennobled at the
end of the reign of Louis XIV. He died about 1821. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

BRUEL (Madame du), wife of the preceding. She survived him. She was
the mother of the dramatic author Jean-Francois du Bruel, christened
Cursy on the Parisian bill-boards. Although a bourgeoisie of strict
ideas, Mme. du Bruel welcomed the dancer Tullia, who became her
daughter-in-law. [A Prince of Bohemia.]

BRUEL (Jean-Francois du), son of the preceding; born about 1797. In
1816 he obtained a place under the Minister of Finance, thanks to the
favor of the Duc de Navarreins. [A Bachelor's Establishment.] He was
sub-chief of Rabourdin's office when the latter, in 1824, contested
with M. Baudoyer for a place of division chief. [The Government
Clerks.] In November, 1825, Jean-Francois du Bruel assisted at a
breakfast given at the "Rocher de Cancale" to the clerks of Desroches'
office by Frederic Marest who was treating to celebrate his incoming.
He was present also at the orgy which followed at Florentine's home.
[A Start in Life.] M. du Bruel successively rose to be chief of
bureau, director, councillor of state, deputy, peer of France and
commander of the Legion of Honor; he received the title of count and
entered one of the classes in the Institute. All this was accomplished
through his wife, Claudine Chaffaroux, formerly the dancer, Tullia,
whom he married in 1829. [A Prince of Bohemia. The Middle Classes.]
For a long time he wrote vaudeville sketches over the name of Cursy.
Nathan, the poet, found it necessary to unite with him. Du Bruel would
make use of the author's ideas, condensing them into small, sprightly
skits which always scored successes for the actors. Du Bruel and
Nathan discovered the actress Florine. They were the authors of
"L'Alcade dans l'embarras," an imbroglio in three acts, played at the
Theatre du Panorama-Dramatique about 1822, when Florine made her
debut, playing with Coralie and Bouffe, the latter under the name of
Vignol. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris. A Daughter of Eve.]

BRUEL (Claudine Chaffaroux, Madame du), born at Nanterre in 1799. One
of the /premiere danseuses/ of the Opera from 1817 to 1827. For
several years she was the mistress of the Duc de Rhetore [A Bachelor's
Establishment.], and afterwards of Jean-Francois du Bruel, who was
much in love with her in 1823, and married her in 1829. She had then
left the stage. About 1834 she met Charles Edouard de la Palferine and
formed a violent attachment for him. In order to please him and pose
in his eyes as a great lady, she urged her husband to the constant
pursuit of honors, and finally achieved the title of countess.
Nevertheless she continued to play the lady of propriety and found
entrance into bourgeoisie society. [A Prince of Bhoemia. A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris. Letters of Two Brides.] In 1840, to
please Mme. Colleville, her friend, she tried to obtain a decoration
for Thuillier. [The Middle Classes.] Mme. du Bruel bore the name of
Tullia on the stage and in the "gallant" circle. She lived then in rue
Chauchat, in a house afterwards occupied by Mmes. Mirah and Brisetout,
when Claudine moved after her marriage to rue de la Victoire.

BRUNET, bailiff at Blagny, Burgundy, in 1823. He was also councillor
of the Canton during the Terror, having for practitioners Michel Vert
alias Vermichel and Fourchon the elder. [The Peasantry.]

BRUNNER (Gedeon), father of Frederic Brunner. At the time of the
French Restoration and of Louis Philippe he owned the great Holland
House at Frankford-on-the-Main. One of the early railway projectors.
He died about 1844, leaving four millions. Calvinist. Twice married.
[Cousin Pons.]

BRUNNER (Madame), first wife of Gedeon Brunner, and mother of Frederic
Brunner. A relative of the Virlaz family, well-to-do Jewish furriers
of Leipsic. A converted Jew. Her dowry was the basis of her husband's
fortune. She died young, leaving a son aged but twelve. [Cousin Pons.]

BRUNNER (Madame), second wife of Gedeon Brunner. The only daughter of
a German inn-keeper. She had been very badly spoiled by her parents.
Sterile, dissipated and prodigal, she made her husband very unhappy,
thus avenging the first Mme. Brunner. She was a step-mother of the
most abominable sort, launching her stepson into an unbridled life,
hoping that debauchery would devour both the child and the Jewish
fortune. After ten years of wedded life she died before her parents,
having made great inroads upon Gedeon Brunner's property. [Cousin
Pons.]

BRUNNER (Frederic), only son of Gedeon Brunner, born within the first
four years of the century. He ran through his maternal inheritance by
silly dissipations, and then helped his friend Wilhelm Schwab to make
away with the hundred thousand francs his parents had left him.
Without resources and cast adrift by his father he went to Paris in
1835, where, upon the recommendation of Graff, the inn-keeper, he
obtained a position with Keller at six hundred francs per annum. In
1843 he was only two thousand francs ahead; but Gedeon Brunner having
died, he became a multi-millionaire. Then for friendship's sake he
founded, with his chum Wilhelm, the banking house of "Brunner, Schwab
& Co.," on rue Richelieu, between rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs and rue
Villedo, in a magnificent building belonging to the tailor, Wolfgang
Graff. Frederic Brunner had been presented by Sylvain Pons to the
Camusots de Marville; he would have married their daughter had she not
been the only child. The breaking off of this match involved also, the
relations of Pons with the De Marville family and resulted in the
death of the musician. [Cousin Pons.]

BRUNO, /valet de chambre/ of Corentin at Passy, on rue des Vignes, in
1830. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] About 1840 he was again in the
service of Corentin, who was now known as M. du Portail and lived on
rue Honore-Chevalier, at Paris. [The Middle Classes.] This name is
sometimes spelled Bruneau.

Alencon, in 1799, where Alphonse de Montauran met Mlle. de Verneuil
for the first time. [The Chouans.]

Mme. Vauquer on the heights of Sainte-Genevieve, Paris, in 1819.
[Father Goriot.]

BUTIFER, noted hunter, poacher and smuggler, living in the village
hard by Grenoble, where Dr. Benassis located, during the Restoration.
When the doctor arrived in the country, Butifer drew a bead on him, in
a corner of the forest. Later, however, he became entirely devoted to
him. He was charged by Genestas with the physical education of this
officer's adopted son. It may be that Butifer enlisted in Genestas'
regiment, after the death of Dr. Benassis. [The Country Doctor.]

BUTSCHA (Jean), head-clerk of Maitre Latournelle, a notary at Havre in
1829. Born about 1804. The natural son of a Swedish sailor and a
Demoiselle Jacmin of Honfleur. A hunchback. A type of intelligence and
devotion. Entirely subservient to Modeste Mignon, whom he loved
without hope; he aided, by many adroit methods, to bring about her
marriage with Ernest de la Briere. Butscha decided that this union
would make the young lady happy. [Modeste Mignon.]



C

CABIROLLE, in charge of the stages of Minoret-Levrault, postmaster of
Nemours. Probably a widower, with one son. About 1837, a sexagenarian,
he married Antoinette Patris, called La Bougival, who was over fifty,
but whose income amounted to twelve hundred francs. [Ursule Mirouet.]

CABIROLLE, son of the preceding. In 1830 he was Dr. Minoret's coachman
at Nemours. Later he was coachman for Savinien de Portenduere, after
the vicomte's marriage with Ursule Mirouet. [Ursule Mirouet.]

servant, marrying Cabirolle about 1837. [Ursule Mirouet.]

CABIROLLE (Madame), mother of Florentine, the /danseuse/. Formerly
janitress on rue Pastourelle, but living in 1820 with her daughter on
rue de Crussol in a modest affluence assured by Cardot the old silk-
dealer, since 1817. According to Girondeau, she was a woman of sense.
[A Start in Life. A Bachelor's Establishment.]

CABIROLLE (Agathe-Florentine), known as Florentine; born in 1804. In
1817, upon leaving Coulon's class, she was discovered by Cardot, the
old silk-merchant, and established by him with her mother in a
relatively comfortable flat on rue de Crussol. After having been
featured at the Gaite theatre, in 1820, she danced for the first time
in a spectacular drama entitled "The Ruins of Babylon."* Immediately
afterwards she succeeded Mariette as /premiere danseuse/ at the
theatre of the Porte-Saint-Martin. Then in 1823 she made her debut at
the Opera in a trio skit with Mariette and Tullia. At the time when
Cardot "protected" her, she had for a lover the retired Captain
Girondeau, and was intimate with Philippe Bridau, to whom she gave
money when in need. In 1825 Florentine occupied Coralie's old flat,
now for some three years, and it was at this place that Oscar Husson
lost at play the money entrusted to him by his employer, Desroches the
attorney, and was surprised by his uncle, Cardot. [A Start in Life.

*   By Renee-Charles Guilbert de Pixerecourt; played for the first
    time at Paris in 1810.

CABOT (Armand-Hippolyte), a native of Toulouse who, in 1800,
established a hair-dressing salon on the Place de la Bourse, Paris. On
the advice of his customer, the poet Parny, he had taken the name of
Marius, a sobriquet which stuck to the establishment. In 1845 Cabot
had earned an income of twenty-four thousand francs and lived at
Libourne, while a fifth Marius, called Mougin, managed the business
founded by him. [The Unconscious Humorists.]

CABOT (Marie-Anne), known as Lajeunesse, an old servant of Marquis
Carol d'Esgrignon. Implicated in the affair of the "Chauffeurs of
Mortagne" and executed in 1809. [The Seamy Side of History.]

CACHAN, attorney at Angouleme under the Restoration. He and Petit-
Claud had similar business interests and the same clients. In 1830
Cachan, now mayor of Marsac, had dealings with the Sechards. [Lost
Illusions. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

CADENET, Parisian wine-merchant, in 1840, on the ground-floor of a
furnished lodging-house, corner of rue des Postes and rue des Poules.
Cerizet also dwelt there at that time. Cadenet, who was proprietor of
the house, had something to do with the transactions of Cerizet, the
"banker of the poor." [The Middle Classes.]

CADIGNAN (Prince de), a powerful lord of the former regime, father of
the Duc de Maufrigneuse, father-in-law of the Duc de Navarreins.
Ruined by the Revolution, he had regained his properties and income on
the accession of the Bourbons. But he was a spendthrift and devoured
everything. He also ruined his wife. He died at an advanced age some
time before the Revolution of July. [The Secrets of a Princess.] At
the end of 1829, the Prince de Cadignan, then Grand Huntsman to
Charles X., rode in a great chase where were also found, amid a very
aristocratic throng, the Duc d'Herouville, organizer of the jaunt,
Canalis and Ernest de la Briere, all three of whom were suitors for
the hand of Modeste Mignon. [Modeste Mignon.]

CADIGNAN (Prince and Princesse de), son and daughter-in-law of the
preceding. (See Maufrigneuse, Duc and Duchesse de.)

CADINE (Jenny), actress at the Gymnase theatre, times of Charles X.
and Louis Philippe. The most frolicsome of women, the only rival of
Dejazet. Born in 1814. Discovered, trained and "protected" from
thirteen years old on, by Baron Hulot. Intimate friend of Josepha
Mirah. [Cousin Betty.] Between 1835 and 1840, while maintained by
Couture, she lived on rue Blanche in a delightful little ground-floor
flat with its own garden. Fabien du Ronceret and Mme. Schontz
succeeded her here. [Beatrix.] In 1845 she was Massol's mistress and
lived on rue de la Victoire. At this time, she apparently led astray
in short order Palafox Gazonal, who had been taken to her home by
Bixiou and Leon de Lora. [The Unconscious Humorists.] About this time
she was the victim of a jewelry theft. After the arrest of the thieves
her property was returned by Saint-Esteve--Vautrin--who was then chief
of the special service. [The Member for Arcis.]

CADOT (Mademoiselle), old servant-mistress of Judge Blondet at
Alencon, during the Restoration. She pampered her master, and, like
him, preferred the elder of the magistrate's two sons. [Jealousies of
a Country Town.]

CALVI (Theodore), alias Madeleine. Born in 1803. A Corsican condemned
to the galleys for life on account of eleven murders committed by the
time he was eighteen. A member of the same gang with Vautrin from 1819
to 1820. Escaped with him. Having assassinated the widow Pigeau of
Nanterre, in May, 1830, he was rearrested and this time sentenced to
death. The plotting of Vautrin, who bore for him an unnatural
affection, saved his life; the sentence was commuted. [Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.]

CAMBON, lumber merchant, a deputy mayor to Benassis, in 1829, in a
community near Grenoble, and a devoted assistant in the work of
regeneration undertaken by the doctor. [The Country Doctor.]

CAMBREMER (Pierre), fisherman of Croisic on the Lower-Loire, time of
Louis Philippe, who, for the honor of a jeopardized name, had cast his
only son into the sea and afterwards remained desolate and a widower
on a cliff near by, in expiation of his crime induced by paternal
justice. [A Seaside Tragedy. Beatrix.]

CAMBREMER (Joseph), younger brother of Pierre Cambremer, father of
Pierrette, called Perotte. [A Seaside Tragedy.]

CAMBREMER (Jacques), only son of Pierre Cambremer and Jacquette
Brouin. Spoiled by his parents, his mother especially, he became a
rascal of the worst type. Jacques Cambremer evaded justice only by
reason of the fact that his father gagged him and cast him into the
sea. [A Seaside Tragedy.]

CAMBREMER (Madame), born Jacquette Brouin, wife of Pierre Cambremer
and mother of Jacques. She was of Guerande; was educated; could write
"like a clerk"; taught her son to read and this brought about his
ruin. She was usually spoken of as the beautiful Brouin. She died a
few days after Jacques. [A Seaside Tragedy.]

CAMBREMER (Pierrette), known as Perotte; daughter of Joseph Cambremer;
niece of Pierre and his goddaughter. Every morning the sweet and
charming creature came to bring her uncle the bread and water upon
which he subsisted. [A Seaside Tragedy.]

CAMERISTUS, celebrated physician of Paris under Louis Philippe; the
Ballanche of medicine and one of the defenders of the abstract
doctrines of Van Helmont; chief of the "Vitalists" opposed to Brisset
who headed the "Organists." He as well as Brisset was called in
consultation regarding a very serious malady afflicting Raphael de
Valentin. [The Magic Skin.]

CAMPS (Octave de), lover then husband of Mme. Firmiani. She made him
restore the entire fortune of a family named Bourgneuf, ruined in a
lawsuit by Octave's father, thus reducing him to the necessity of
making a living by teaching mathematics. He was only twenty-two years
old when he met Mme. Firmiani. He married her first at Gretna Green.
The marriage at Paris took place in 1824 or 1825. Before marriage,
Octave de Camps lived on rue de l'Observance. He was a descendant of
the famous Abbe de Camps, so well known among bookmen and savants.
[Madame Firmiani.] Octave de Camps reappears as an ironmaster, during
the reign of Louis Philippe. At this time he rarely resided at Paris.
[The Member for Arcis.]

CAMPS (Madame Octave de), nee Cadignan; niece of the old Prince de
Cadignan; cousin of the Duc de Maufrigneuse. In 1813, at the age of
sixteen, she married M. Firmiani, receiver-general in the department
of Montenotte. M. Firmiani died in Greece about 1822, and she became
Mme. de Camps in 1824 or 1825. At this time she dwelt on rue du Bac
and had entree into the home of Princesse de Blamont-Chauvry, the
oracle of Faubourg Saint-Germain. An accomplished and excellent lady,
loved even by her rivals, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, her cousin,
Mme. de Macumer--Louise de Chaulieu--and the Marquise d'Espard.
[Madame Firmiani.] She welcomed and protected Mme. Xavier Rabourdin.
[The Government Clerks.] At the close of 1824 she gave a ball where
Charles de Vandenesse made the acquaintance of Mme. d'Aiglemont whose
lover he became. [A Woman of Thirty.] In 1834 Mme. Octave de Camps
tried to check the slanders going the rounds at the expense of Mme.
Felix de Vandenesse, who had compromised herself somewhat on account
of the poet Nathan; and Mme. de Camps gave the young woman some good
advice. [A Daughter of Eve.] On another occasion she gave exceedingly
good counsel to Mme. de l'Estorade, who was afraid of being smitten
with Sallenauve. [The Member for Arcis.] Mme. Firmiani, "that was,"
shared her time between Paris and the furnaces of M. de Camps; but she
gave the latter much the preference--at least so said one of her
intimate friends, Mme. de l'Estorade. [The Member for Arcis.]

CAMUSET, one of Bourignard's assumed names.

CAMUSOT, silk-merchant, rue des Bourdonnais, Paris, under the
Restoration. Born in 1765. Son-in-law and successor of Cardot, whose
eldest daughter he had married. At that time he was a widower, his
first wife being a Demoiselle Pons, sole heiress of the celebrated
Pons family, embroiderers to the Court during the Empire. About 1834
Camusot retired from business, and became a member of the
Manufacturers' Council, deputy, peer of France and baron. He had four
children. In 1821-1822 he maintained Coralie, who became so violently
enamored of Lucien de Rubempre. Although she abandoned him for Lucien,
he promised the poet, after the actress' death, that he would purchase
for her a permanent plot in the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise. [A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris. A Bachelor's Establishment. Cousin
Pons.] Later he was intimate with Fanny Beaupre for some time. [The
Muse of the Department.] He and his wife were present at Cesar
Birotteau's big ball in December, 1818; he was also chosen commissary-
judge of the perfumer's bankruptcy, instead of Gobenheim-Keller, who
was first designated. [Cesar Birotteau.] He had dealings with the
Guillaumes, clothing merchants, rue Saint-Denis. [At the Sign of the
Cat and Racket.]

CAMUSOT DE MARVILLE, son of Camusot the silk-merchant by his first
marriage. Born about 1794. During Louis Philippe's reign he took the
name of a Norman estate and green, Marville, in order to distinguish
between himself and a half-brother. In 1824, then a judge at Alencon,
he helped render an alibi decision in favor of Victurnien d'Esgrignon,
who really was guilty. [Cousin Pons. Jealousies of a Country Town.] He
was judge at Paris in 1828, and was appointed to replace Popinot in
the court which was to render a decision concerning the appeal for
interdiction presented by Mme. d'Espard against her husband. [The
Commission in Lunacy.] In May, 1830, in the capacity of judge of
instruction, he prepared a report tending to the liberation of Lucien
de Rubempre, accused of assassinating Esther Gobseck. But the suicide
of the poet rendered the proposed measure useless, besides upsetting,
momentarily, the ambitious projects of the magistrate. [Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.] Camusot de Marville had been president of the Court
of Nantes. In 1844 he was president of the Royal Court of Paris and
commander of the Legion of Honor. At this time he lived in a house on
rue de Hanovre, purchased by him in 1834, where he received the
musician Pons, a cousin of his. The President de Marville was elected
deputy in 1846. [Cousin Pons.]

CAMUSOT DE MARVILLE (Madame), born Thirion, Marie-Cecile-Amelie, in
1798. Daughter of an usher of the Cabinet of Louis XVIII. Wife of the
magistrate. In 1814 she frequented the studio of the painter Servin,
who had a class for young ladies. This studio contained two factions;
Mlle. Thirion headed the party of the nobility, though of ordinary
birth, and persecuted Ginevra di Piombo, of the Bonapartist party.
[The Vendetta.] In 1818 she was invited to accompany her father and
mother to the famous ball of Cesar Birotteau. It was about the time
her marriage with Camusot de Marville was being considered. [Cesar
Birotteau.] This wedding took place in 1819, and immediately the
imperious young woman gained the upper hand with the judge, making him
follow her own will absolutely and in the interests of her boundless
ambition. It was she who brought about the discharge of young
d'Esgrignon in 1824, and the suicide of Lucien de Rubempre in 1830.
Through her, the Marquis d'Espard failed of interdiction. However,
Mme. de Marville had no influence over her father-in-law, the senior
Camusot, whom she bored dreadfully and importuned excessively. She
caused, also, by her evil treatment, the death of Sylvain Pons "the
poor relation," inheriting with her husband his fine collection of
curios. [Jealousies of a Country Town. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.
Cousin Pons.]

CAMUSOT (Charles), son of the preceding couple. He died young, at a
time when his parents had neither land nor title of Marville, and when
they were in almost straitened circumstances. [Cousin Pons.]

CAMUSOT DE MARVILLE (Cecile). (See Popinot, Vicomtesse.)

CANALIS (Constant-Cyr-Melchior, Baron de), poet--chief of the
"Angelic" school--deputy minister, peer of France, member of the
French Academy, commander of the Legion of Honor. Born at Canalis,
Correze, in 1800. About 1821 he became the lover of Mme. de Chaulieu,
who was constantly aiding him to high positions, but who, at the same
time, was always very exacting. Not long after, Canalis is seen at the
opera in Mme. d'Espard's box, being presented to Lucien de Rubempre.
From 1824 he was the fashionable poet. [Letters of Two Brides. A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] In 1829 he lived at number 29 rue
Paradis-Poissoniere (now simply rue Paradis) and was master of
requests in the Council of State. This is the time when he was in
correspondence with Modeste Mignon and wished to espouse that rich
heiress. [Modeste Mignon.] Shortly after 1830, now a great man, he was
present at Mlle. des Touches', when Henri de Marsay told of his first
love affair. Canalis took part in the conversation and uttered a most
vigorous tirade against Napoleon. [The Magic Skin. Another Study of
Woman.] In 1838 he married the daughter of Moreau (de l'Oise), who
brought him a very large dowry. [A Start in Life.] In October, 1840,
he and Mme. de Rochefide were present at a performance at the Varietes
theatre, where that dangerous woman was encountered again after a
lapse of three years by Calyste du Guenic. [Beatrix.] In 1845 Canalis
was pointed out in the Chamber of Deputies by Leon de Lora to Palafox
Gazonal. [The Unconscious Humorists.] In 1845, he consented to act as
second to Sallenauve in his duel with Maxime de Trailles. [The Member
for Arcis.]

CANALIS (Baronne Melchior de), wife of the preceding and daughter of
M. and Mme. Moreau (de l'Oise). About the middle of the reign of Louis
Philippe, she being then recently married, she made a journey to
Seine-et-Oise. She went first to Beaumont and Presles. Mme. de Canalis
with her daughter and the Academician, occupied Pierrotin's stage-
coach. [A Start in Life.]

CANE (Marco-Facino), known as Pere Canet, a blind old man, an inmate
of the Hospital des Quinze-Vingts, who during the Restoration followed
the vocation of musician, at Paris. He played the clarionet at a ball
of the working-people of rue de Charenton, on the occasion of the
wedding of Mme. Vaillant's sister. He said he was a Venetian, Prince
de Varese, a descendant of the /condottiere/ Facino Cane, whose
conquests fell into the hands of the Duke of Milan. He told strange
stories regarding his patrician youth. He died in 1820, more than an
octogenarian. He was the last of the Canes on the senior branch, and
he transmitted the title of Prince de Varese to a relative, Emilio
Memmi. [Facino Cane. Massimilla Doni.]

CANTE-CROIX (Marquis de), under-lieutenant in one of the regiments
which tarried at Angouleme from November, 1807, to March, 1808, while
on its way to Spain. He was a Colonel at Wagram on July 6, 1809,
although only twenty-six years old, when a shot crushed over his heart
the picture of Mme. de Bargeton, whom he loved. [Lost Illusions.]

CANTINET, an old glass-dealer, and beadle of Saint-Francois church,
Marais, Paris, in 1845; dwelt on rue d'Orleans. A drunken idler.
[Cousin Pons.]

CANTINET (Madame), wife of preceding; renter of seats in Saint-
Francois. Last nurse of Sylvain Pons, and a tool to the interests of
Fraisier and Poulain. [Cousin Pons.]

CANTINET, Junior, would have been made beadle of Saint-Francois, where
his father and mother were employed, but he preferred the theatre. He
was connected with the Cirque-Olympique in 1845. He caused his mother
sorrow, by a dissolute life and by forcible inroads on the maternal
purse. [Cousin Pons.]

CAPRAJA, a noble Venetian, a recognized dilettante, living only by and
through music. Nicknamed "Il Fanatico." Known by the Duke and Duchess
Cataneo and their friends. [Massimilla Doni.]

CARBONNEAU, physician whom the Comte de Mortsauf spoke of consulting
about his wife, in 1820, instead of Dr. Origet, whom he fancied to be
unsatisfactory. [The Lily of the Valley.]

CARCADO (Madame de), founder of a Parisian benevolent society, for
which Mme. de la Baudraye was appointed collector, in March, 1843, on
the request of some priests, friends of Mme. Piedefer. This choice
resulted, noteworthily, in the re-entrance into society of the "muse,"
who had been beguiled and compromised by her relations with Lousteau.
[The Muse of the Department.]

CARDANET (Madame de), grandmother of Mme. de Senonches. [Lost
Illusions.]

CARDINAL (Madame), Parisian fish-vender, daughter of one Toupillier, a
carrier. Widow of a well-known marketman. Niece of Toupillier the
pauper of Saint-Sulpice, from whom in 1840, with Cerizet's assistance,
she tried to capture the hidden treasure. This woman had three
sisters, four brothers, and three uncles, who would have shared with
her the pauper's bequest. The scheming of Mme. Cardinal and Cerizet
was frustrated by M. du Portail--Corentin. [The Middle Classes.]

CARDINAL (Olympe). (See Cerizet, Madame.)

CARDOT (Jean-Jerome-Severin), born in 1755. Head-clerk in an old silk-
house, the "Golden Cocoon," rue des Bourdonnais. He bought the
establishment in 1793, at the "maximum" moment, and in ten years had
made a large fortune, thanks to the dowry of one hundred thousand
francs brought him by his wife; she was a Demoiselle Husson, and gave
him four children. Of these, the elder daughter married Camusot, who
succeeded his father-in-law; the second, Marianne, married Protez, of
the firm of Protez & Chiffreville; the elder son became a notary; the
younger son, Joseph, took an interest in Matifat's drug business.
Cardot was the "protector" of the actress, Florentine, whom he
discovered and started. In 1822 he lived at Belleville in one of the
first houses above Courtille; he had then been a widower for six
years. He was an uncle of Oscar Husson, and had taken some interest in
and helped the dolt, until an incident occurred that changed
everything: the old man discovered the young fellow asleep one
morning, on one of Florentine's divans, after an orgy wherein he had
squandered the money entrusted to him by his employer, Desroches the
attorney. [A Start in Life. Lost Illusions. A Distinguished Provincial
at Paris. A Bachelor's Establishment.] Cardot had dealings with the
Guillaumes, clothiers, rue Saint-Denis. [At the Sign of the Cat and
Racket.] He and his entire family were invited to the great ball given
by Cesar Birotteau, December 17, 1818. [Cesar Birotteau.]

CARDOT, elder son of the preceding. Parisian notary, successor of
Sorbier. Born in 1794. Married to a Demoiselle Chiffreville, of a
family of celebrated chemists. Three children were born to them: a son
who in 1836 was fourth clerk in his father's business, and should have
succeeded him, but dreamed instead of literary fame; Felicie, who
married Berthier; and another daughter, born in 1824. The notary
Cardot maintained Malaga, during the reign of Louis Philippe. [The
Muse of the Department. A Man of Business. Jealousies of a Country
Town.] He was attorney for Pierre Grassou, who deposited his savings
with him every quarter. [Pierre Grassou.] He was also notary to the
Thuilliers, and, in 1840, had presented in their drawing-rooms, on rue
Saint-Dominique d'Enfer, Godeschal an aspirant for the hand of Celeste
Colleville. After living on Place du Chatelet, Cardot become one of
the tenants of the house purchased by the Thuilliers, near the
Madeleine. [The Middle Classes.] In 1844 he was mayor and deputy of
Paris. [Cousin Pons.]

CARDOT (Madame) nee Chiffreville, wife of Cardot the notary. Very
devoted, but a "wooden" woman, a "veritable penitential brush." About
1840 she lived on Place du Chatelet, Paris, with her husband. At this
time, the notary's wife took her daughter Felicie to rue des Martyrs,
to the home of Etienne Lousteau, whom she had planned to have for a
son-in-law, but whom she finally threw over on account of the
journalist's dissipated ways. [The Muse of the Department.]

CARDOT (Felicie or Felicite). (See Berthier, Madame.)

CARIGLIANO (Marechal, Duc de), one of the illustrious soldiers of the
Empire; husband of a Demoiselle Malin de Gondreville, whom he
worshipped, obeyed and stood in awe of, but who deceived him. [At the
Sign of the Cat and Racket.] In 1819, Marechal de Carigliano gave a
ball where Eugene de Rastignac was presented by his cousin, the
Vicomtesse de Beauseant, at the time he entered the world of fashion.
[Father Goriot.] During the Restoration he owned a beautiful house
near the Elysee-Bourbon, which he sold to M. de Lanty. [Sarrasine.]

CARIGLIANO (Duchesse de), wife of the preceding, daughter of Senator
Malin de Gondreville. At the end of the Empire, when thirty-six years
of age, she was the mistress of the young Colonel d'Aiglemont, and of
Sommervieux, the painter, almost at the same time; the latter had
recently wedded Augustine Guillaume. The Duchesse de Carigliano
received a visit from Mme. de Sommervieux, and gave her very ingenious
advice concerning the method of conquering her husband, and binding
him forever to her by her coquetry. [At the Sign of the Cat and
Racket.] In 1821-1822 she had an opera-box near Mme. d'Espard. Sixte
du Chatelet came to her to make his acknowledgments on the evening
when Lucien de Rubempre, a newcomer in Paris, cut such a sorry figure
at the theatre in company with Mme. de Bargeton. [A Distinguished
Provincial at Paris.] It was the Duchesse de Carigliano who, after a
great effort, found a wife suited to General de Montcornet, in the
person of Mlle. de Troisville. [The Peasantry.] Mme. de Carigliano,
although a Napoleonic duchesse, was none the less devoted to the House
of the Bourbons, being attached especially to the Duchesse de Berry.
Becoming imbued also with a high degree of piety, she visited nearly
every year a retreat of the Ursulines of Arcis-sur-Aube. In 1839
Sallenauve's friends counted on the duchesse's support to elect him
deputy. [The Member for Arcis.]

CARON, lawyer, in charge of the affairs of Mlle. Gamard at Tours in
1826. He acted against Abbe Francois Birotteau. [The Vicar of Tours.]

CARPENTIER, formerly captain in the Imperial Army, retired at Issoudun
during the Restoration. He had a position in the mayor's office. He
was allied by marriage to one of the strongest families of the city,
the Borniche-Hereaus. He was an intimate friend of the artillery
captain, Mignonnet, sharing with him his aversion for Commandant
Maxence Gilet. Carpentier and Mignonnet were seconds of Philippe
Bridau in his duel with the chief of the "Knights of Idlesse." [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

CARPI (Benedetto), jailer of a Venetian prison, where Facino Cane was
confined between the years 1760 and 1770. Bribed by the prisoner, he

CASA-REAL (Duc de), younger brother of Mme. Balthazar Claes; related
to the Evangelistas of Bordeaux; of an illustrious family under the
Spanish monarchy; his sister had renounced the paternal succession in
order to procure for him a marriage worthy of a house so noble. He
died young, in 1805, leaving to Mme. Claes, a considerable fortune in
money. [The Quest of the Absolute. A Marriage Settlement.]

CASTAGNOULD, mate of the "Mignon," a pretty, hundred-ton vessel owned
by Charles Mignon, the captain. In this he made several important and
prosperous voyages, from 1826 to 1829. Castagnould was a Provencal and
an old servant of the Mignon family. [Modeste Mignon.]

CASTANIER (Rodolphe), retired chief of squadron in the dragoons, under
the Empire. Cashier of Baron de Nucingen during the Restoration. Wore
the decoration of the Legion of Honor. He maintained Mme. de la
Garde--Aquilina--and on her account, in 1821, he counterfeited the
banker's name on a letter of credit for a considerable amount. John
Melmoth, an Englishman, got him out of this scrape by exchanging his
own individuality for that of the old officer. Castanier was thus all-
powerful, but becoming promptly at outs with the proceeding, he
adopted the same tactics of exchange, transferring his power to a
financier named Claparon. Castanier was a Southerner. He had seen
service from sixteen till nearly forty. [Melmoth Reconciled.]

CASTANIER (Madame), wife of the preceding, married during the first
Empire. Her family--that of the bourgeoisie of Nancy--fooled Castanier
about the size of her dowry and her "expectations." Mme. Castanier was
honest, ugly and sour-tempered. She was separated from her husband, to
his relief, and for several years previous to 1821 lived in the
suburbs of Strasbourg. [Melmoth Reconciled.]

CASTERAN (De), a very ancient aristocracy of Normandy; related to
William the Conqueror; allied with the Verneuils, the Esgrignons and
the Troisvilles. The name is pronounced "Cateran." A Demoiselle
Blanche de Casteran was the mother of Mlle. de Verneuil, and died
Abbess of Notre-Dame de Seez. [The Chouans.] In 1807 Mme. de la
Chanterie, then a widow, was hospitably received in Normandy by the
Casterans. [The Seamy Side of History.] In 1822 a venerable couple,
Marquis and Marquise de Casteran visited the drawing-room of Marquis
d'Esgrignon at Alencon. [Jealousies of a Country Town.] The Marquise
de Rochefide, nee Beatrix Maximilienne-Rose de Casteran, was the
younger daughter of a Marquis de Casteran who wished to marry off both
his daughters without dowries, and thus save his entire fortune for
his son, the Comte de Casteran. [Beatrix.] A Comte de Casteran, son-
in-law of the Marquis of Troisville, relative of Mme. de Montcornet,
was prefect of a department of Burgundy between 1820 and 1825. [The
Peasantry.]

CATANEO (Duke), noble Sicilian, born in 1773; first husband of
Massimilla Doni. Physically ruined by early debaucheries, he was a
husband only in name, living only by and through the influence of
music. Very wealthy, he had educated Clara Tinti, discovered by him
when still a child and a simple tavern servant. The young girl became,
thanks to him, the celebrated prima donna of the Fenice theatre, at
Venice in 1820. The wonderful tenor Genovese, of the same theatre, was
also a protege of Duke Cataneo, who paid him a high salary to sing
only with La Tinti. The Duke Cataneo cut a sorry figure. [Massimilla
Doni.]

CATANEO (Duchess), nee Massimilla Doni, wife of the preceding; married
later to Emilio Memmi, Prince de Varese. (See Princesse de Varese.)

CATHERINE, an old woman in the service of M. and Mme. Saillard, in
1824. [The Government Clerks.]

1803. A handsome girl of nineteen. According to Gothard, Catherine was
in all her mistress' secrets and furthered all her schemes. [The
Gondreville Mystery.]

CAVALIER, Fendant's partner; both were book-collectors, publishers and
venders in Paris, on rue Serpente in 1821. Cavalier traveled for the
house, whose firm name appeared as "Fendant and Cavalier." The two
associates failed shortly after having published, without success, the
famous romance of Lucien de Rubempre, "The Archer of Charles IX.,"
which title they had changed for one more fantastic. [A Distinguished
Provincial at Paris.] In 1838, a firm of Cavalier published "The
Spirit of Modern Law" by Baron Bourlac, sharing the profits with the
author. [The Seamy Side of History.]

CAYRON, of Languedoc, a vender of parasols, umbrellas and canes, on
rue Saint-Honore in a house adjacent to that inhabited by Birotteau
the perfumer in 1818. With the consent of the landlord, Molineux,
Cayron sublet two apartments over his shop to his neighbor. He fared
badly in business, suddenly disappearing a short time after the grand
ball given by Birotteau. Cayron admired Birotteau. [Cesar Birotteau.]

CELESTIN, /valet de chambre/ of Lucien de Rubempre, on the Malaquais
quai, in the closing years of the reign of Charles X. [Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.]

CERIZET, orphan from the Foundling Hospital, Paris; born in 1802; an
apprentice of the celebrated printers Didot, at whose office he was
noticed by David Sechard, who took him to Angouleme and employed him
in his own shop, where Cerizet performed triple duties of form-maker,
compositor and proof-reader. Presently he betrayed his master, and by
leaguing with the Cointet Brothers, rivals of David Sechard, he
obtained possession of his property. [Lost Illusions.] Following this
he was an actor in the provinces; managed a Liberal paper during the
Restoration; was sub-prefect at the beginning of the reign of Louis
Philippe; and finally was a "man of business." In the latter capacity
he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for swindling. After
business partnership with Georges d'Estourny, and later with Claparon,
he was stranded and reduced to transcribing for a justice of the peace
in the quartier Saint-Jacques. At the same time he began lending money
on short time, and by speculating with the poorer class he acquired a
certain competence. Although thoroughly debauched, Cerizet married
Olympe Cardinal about 1840. At this time he was implicated in the
intrigues of Theodose de la Peyrade and in the interests of Jerome
Thuillier. Becoming possessed of a note of Maxime de Trailles in 1833,
he succeeded by Scapinal tactics in obtaining face value of the paper.
[A Man of Business. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. The Middle
Classes.]

CERIZET (Olympe Cardinal, Madame), wife of foregoing; born about 1824;
daughter of Mme. Cardinal the fish-dealer. Actress at the Bobino,

in "The Telegraph of Love." At first she was intimate with the first

of the latter she received thirty thousand francs to renounce her son.
This money she used as a dowry and it aided in consummating her
marriage with Cerizet. [The Middle Classes.]

CESARINE, laundry girl at Alencon. Mistress of the Chevalier de
Valois, and mother of a child that was attributed to the old
aristocrat. It was also said in the town, in 1816, that he had married

since he had hoped at this time to wed Mlle. Cormon. Cesarine, the
sole legatee of her lover, received an income of only six hundred
livres. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

CESARINE, dancer at the Opera de Paris in 1822; an acquaintance of
Philippe Bridau, who at one time thought of breaking off with her on

colonel of a cavalry regiment. Left for dead on the battlefield of
Eylau (February 7-8, 1807). He was healed at Heilsberg, then locked up
in an insane asylum at Stuttgart. Returning to France after the
downfall of the Empire, he lived, in 1818, in straitened
circumstances, with the herdsman Vergniaud, an old lieutenant of his
regiment, on rue du Petit-Banquier, Paris. After having sought without
arousing scandal to make good his rights with Rose Chapotel, his wife,
now married to Count Ferraud, he sank again into poverty and was
convicted of vagrancy. He ended his days at the Hospital de Bicetre;
they had begun at the Foundling Hospital. [Colonel Chabert.]

was a friend of Gobseck and of Gigonnet and with them he frequented,
in 1824, the Cafe Themis. [The Government Clerks.] During the reign of
Louis Philippe he had dealings with the Cerizet-Claparon Company. [A
Man of Business.]

CHAFFAROUX, building-contractor, one of Cesar Birotteau's creditors
[Cesar Birotteau]; uncle of Claudine Chaffaroux who became Mme. du
Bruel. Rich and a bachelor, he showered much affection upon his niece;
she had helped him to launch into business. He died in the second half
of the reign of Louis Philippe, leaving an income of forty thousand
francs to the former /danseuse/. [A Prince of Bohemia.] In 1840 he did
some work on an unfinished house in the suburbs of the Madeleine,
purchased by the Thuilliers. [The Middle Classes.]

CHAMAROLLES (Mesdemoiselles), conducted a boarding-school for young
ladies at Bourges, at the beginning of the century. This school

Bargeton's drawing-room at Angouleme, and the "beau" of that society.
In 1821 he was decorated. He obtained some success with the ladies by
his sarcastic pleasantries in the fashion of the eighteenth century.
Having spread about town a slander relating to Mme. de Bargeton and
Lucien de Rubempre, he was challenged by her husband and was wounded
in the neck by a bullet, which wound brought on him a kind of chronic
twist of the neck. [Lost Illusions.]

CHANDOUR (Amelie de), wife of the preceding; charming
conversationalist, but troubled with an unacknowledged asthma. In
Angouleme she posed as the antagonist of her friend, Mme. de Bargeton.

re-establishment of religious worship following the Revolution. Born
in 1755, died in 1841, in that city. He was a friend of Dr. Minoret
and helped educate Ursule Mirouet, a niece of the physician. He was
nicknamed "the Fenelon of Gatinais." His successor was the cure of
Saint-Lange, the priest who tried to give religious consolation to
Mme. d'Aiglemont, a prey to despair. [Ursule Mirouet.]

CHAPOTEL (Rose), family name of Mme. Chabert, who afterwards became
Comtesse Ferraud, which name see.

CHAPOULOT (Monsieur and Madame), formerly lace-dealers of rue Saint-
Denis in 1845. Tenants of the house, rue de Normandie, where lived
Pons and Schmucke. One evening, when M. and Mme. Chapoulot accompanied

l'Ambigu-Comique, they met Heloise Brisetout on the landing, and a
little conjugal scene resulted. [Cousin Pons.]

CHAPUZOT (Monsieur and Madame), porters of Marguerite Turquet, known
as Malaga, rue des Fosses-du-Temple at Paris in 1836; afterwards her
servants and her confidants when she was maintained by Thaddee Paz.

Betty.]

CHARDIN, son of the preceding. At first a watchman for Johann Fischer,
commissariat for the Minister of War in the province of Oran from 1838
to 1841. Afterwards /claqueur/ in a theatre under Braulard, and

mistress of Baron Hulot--Pere Thoul--in 1843. She lived then with him
at number 7 rue des Bernardins. She had succeeded Olympe Bijou in the
old fellow's affections. [Cousin Betty.]

CHARDON, retired surgeon of the army of the Republic; established as a
druggist at Angouleme during the Empire. He was engrossed in trying to
cure the gout, and he also dreamed of replacing rag-paper with paper
made from vegetable fibre, after the manner of the Chinese. He died at
the beginning of the Restoration at Paris, where he had come to
solicit the sanction of the Academy of Science, in despair at the lack
of result, leaving a wife and two children poverty-stricken. [Lost
Illusions.]

CHARDON (Madame), nee Rubempre, wife of the preceding. The final
branch of an illustrious family. Saved from the scaffold in 1793 by

and mother of Olympe Charel who became the wife of Michaud, the head-
keeper of General de Montcornet's estate. [The Peasantry.]

CHARGEBOEUF (Marquis de), a Champagne gentleman, born in 1739, head of
the house of Chargeboeuf in the time of the Consulate and the Empire.
His lands reached from the department of Seine-et-Marne into that of
the Aube. A relative of the Hauteserres and the Simeuses whom he
sought to erase from the emigrant list in 1804, and whom he assisted
in the lawsuit in which they were implicated after the abduction of
Senator Malin. He was also related to Laurence de Cinq-Cygne. The
Chargeboeufs and the Cinq-Cygnes had the same origin, the Frankish
name of Duineff being their joint property. Cinq-Cygne became the name
of the junior branch of the Chargeboeufs. The Marquis de Chargeboeuf
was acquainted with Talleyrand, at whose instance he was enabled to
transmit a petition to First-Consul Bonaparte. M. de Chargeboeuf was
apparently reconciled to the new order of things springing out of the
year '89; at any rate he displayed much politic prudence. His family
reckoned their ancient titles from the Crusades; his name arose from
an equerry's exploit with Saint Louis in Egypt. [The Gondreville
Mystery.]

CHARGEBOEUF (Madame de), mother of Bathilde de Chargeboeuf who married
Denis Rogron. She lived at Troyes with her daughter during the
Restoration. She was poor but haughty. [Pierrette.]

Chargeboeufs. Made sub-prefect of Arcis-sur-Aube in 1815, through the
influence of his kinswoman, Mme. de Cinq-Cygne. It was there that he
met Mme. Severine Beauvisage. A mutual attachment resulted, and a
daughter called Cecile-Renee was born of their intimacy. [The Member
for Arcis.] In 1820 the Vicomte de Chargeboeuf removed to Sancerre
where he knew Mme. de la Baudraye. She would probably have favored
him, had he not been made prefect and left the city. [The Muse of the
Department.]

CHARGEBOEUF (De), secretary of attorney-general Granville at Paris in
1830; then a young man. Entrusted by the magistrate with the details
of Lucien de Rubempre's funeral, which was carried through in such a
way as to make one believe that he had died a free man and in his own
home, on quai Malaquais. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

CHARGEGRAIN (Louis), inn-keeper of Littray, Normandy. He had dealings
with the brigands and was arrested in the suit of the Chauffeurs of
Mortagne, in 1809, but acquitted. [The Seamy Side of History.]

CHARLES, first name of a rather indifferent young painter, who in 1819
boarded at the Vauquer pension. A tutor at college and a Museum
attache; very jocular; given to personal witticisms, which were often
aimed at Goriot. [Father Goriot.]

CHARLES, a young prig who was killed in a duel of small arms with
Raphael de Valentin at Aix, Savoy, in 1831. Charles had boasted of
having received the title of "Bachelor of shooting" from Lepage at
Paris, and that of doctor from Lozes the "King of foils." [The Magic

marquis complained of his servant's carelessness. [A Woman of Thirty.]

CHARLES, footman to Comte de Montcornet at Aigues, Burgundy, in 1823.
Through no good motive he paid court to Catherine Tonsard, being
encouraged in his gallantries by Fourchon the girl's maternal
grandfather, who desired to have a spy in the chateau. In the
peasants' struggle against the people of Aigues, Charles usually sided
with the peasants: "Sprung from the people, their livery remained upon
him." [The Peasantry.]

CHARLOTTE, a great lady, a duchess, and a widow without children. She
was loved by Marsay then only sixteen and some six years younger than
she. She deceived him and he resented by procuring her a rival. She
died young of consumption. Her husband was a statesman. [Another Study
of Woman.]

CHARLOTTE (Madame), name assumed by Mme. Chardon, in 1821 at
Angouleme, when obliged to make a living as a nurse. [Lost Illusions.]

CHATELET (Sixte, Baron du), born in 1776 as plain Sixte Chatelet.
About 1806 he qualified for and later was made baron under the Empire.
His career began with a secretaryship to an Imperial princess. Later
he entered the diplomatic corps, and finally, under the Restoration,
M. de Barante selected him for director of the indirect taxes at
Angouleme. Here he met and married Mme. de Bargeton when she became a
widow in 1821. He was the prefect of the Charente. [Lost Illusions. A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] In 1824 he was count and deputy.
[Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] Chatelet accompanied General Marquis
Armand de Montriveau in a perilous and famous excursion into Egypt.
[The Thirteen.]

CHATELET (Marie-Louise-Anais de Negrepelisse, Baronne du), born in
1785; cousin by marriage of the Marquise d'Espard; married in 1803 to
M. de Bargeton of Angouleme; widow in 1821 and married to Baron Sixte
du Chatelet, prefect of the Charente. Temporarily enamored of Lucien
de Rubempre, she attached him to her party in a journey to Paris made
necessary by provincial slanders and ambition. There she abandoned her
youthful lover at the instigation of Chatelet and of Mme. d'Espard.
[Lost Illusions. A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] In 1824, Mme.
du Chatelet attended Mme. Rabourdin's evening reception. [The
Government Clerks.] Under the direction of Abbe Niolant (or Niollant),
Madame du Chatelet, orphaned of her mother, had been reared a little
too boyishly at l'Escarbas, a small paternal estate situated near
Barbezieux. [Lost Illusions.]

CHATILLONEST (De), an old soldier; father of Marquise d'Aiglemont. He
was hardly reconciled to her marriage with her cousin, the brilliant
colonel. [A Woman of Thirty.] The device of the house of Chatillonest
(or Chastillonest) was: /Fulgens, sequar/ ("Shining, I follow thee").
Jean Butscha had put this device beneath a star on his seal. [Modest
Mignon.]

CHAUDET (Antoine-Denis), sculptor and painter, born in Paris in 1763,
interested in the birth of Joseph Bridau's genius. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

CHAULIEU (Henri, Duc de), born in 1773; peer of France; one of the
gentlemen of the Court of Louis XVIII. and of that of Charles X.,
principally in favor under the latter. After having been ambassador
from France to Madrid, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs at the
beginning of 1830. He had three children: the eldest was the Duc de
Rhetore; the second became Duc de Lenoncourt-Givry through his
marriage with Madeleine de Mortsauf; the third, a daughter, Armande-
Louise-Marie, married Baron de Macumer and, left a widow, afterwards
married the poet Marie Gaston. [Letters of Two Brides. Modeste Mignon.
A Bachelor's Establishment.] The Duc de Chaulieu was on good terms
with the Grandlieus and promised them to obtain the title of marquis
for Lucien de Rubempre, who was aspiring to the hand of their daughter
Clotilde. The Duc de Chaulieu resided in Paris in very close relations
with these same Grandlieus of the elder branch. More than once he took
particular interest in the family's affairs. He employed Corentin to
clear up the dark side of the life of Clotilde's fiance. [Scenes from
a Courtesan's Life.] Some time before this M. de Chaulieu made one of
the portentous conclave assembled to extricate Mme. de Langeais, a
relative of the Grandlieus, from a serious predicament. [The
Thirteen.]

CHAULIEU (Eleonore, Duchesse de), wife of the preceding. She was a
friend of M. d'Aubrion and sought to influence him to bring about the
marriage of Mlle. d'Aubrion with Charles Grandet. [Eugenie Grandet.]
For a long time she was the mistress of the poet Canalis, several
years her junior. She protected him, helping him on in the world, and
in public life, but she was very jealous and kept him under strict
surveillance. She still retained her hold of him at fifty years. Mme.
de Chaulieu gave her husband the three children designated in the
duc's biography. Her hauteur and coquetry subdued most of her maternal
sentiments. During the last year of the second Restoration, Eleonore
de Chaulieu followed on the way to Normandy, not far from Rosny, a
chase almost royal where her sentiments were fully occupied. [Letters
of Two Brides.]

CHAULIEU (Armande-Louise-Marie de), daughter of Duc and Duchesse de
Chaulieu. (See Marie Gaston, Madame.)

CHAUSSARD (The Brothers), inn-keepers at Louvigny, Orne; old game-
keepers of the Troisville estate, implicated in a trial known as the
"Chauffeurs of Mortagne" in 1809. Chaussard the elder was condemned to
twenty years' hard labor, was sent to the galleys, and later was
pardoned by the Emperor. Chaussard junior was contumacious, and
therefore received sentence of death. Later he was cast into the sea
by M. de Boislaurier for having been traitorous to the Chouans. A
third Chaussard, enticed into the ranks of the police by Contenson,
was assassinated in a nocturnal affair. [The Seamy Side of History.]

CHAVONCOURT (De), Besancon gentleman, highly thought of in the town,
representing an old parliamentary family. A deputy under Charles X.,
one of the famous 221 who signed the address to the King on March 18,

Chavoncourt of Besancon. Born in 1818. [Albert Savarus.]

CHAZELLE, clerk under the Minister of Finance, in Baudoyer's bureau,
in 1824. A benedict and wife-led, although wishing to appear his own
master. He argued without ceasing upon subjects and through causes the
idlest with Paulmier the bachelor. The one smoked, the other took
snuff; this different way of taking tobacco was one of the endless
themes between the two. [The Government Clerks.]

CHELIUS, physician of Heidelberg with whom Halpersohn corresponded,
during the reign of Louis Philippe. [The Seamy Side of History.]

CHERVIN, a police-corporal at Montegnac near Limoges in 1829. [The
Country Parson.]

CHESNEL, or Choisnel, notary at Alencon, time of Louis XVIII. Born in
1753. Old attendant of the house of Gordes, also of the d'Esgrignon
family whose property he had protected during the Revolution. A
widower, childless, and possessed of a considerable fortune, he had an
aristocratic clientele, notably that of Mme. de la Chanterie. On every
hand he received that attention which his good points merited. M. du
Bousquier held him in profound hatred, blaming him with the refusal
which Mlle. d'Esgrignon had made of Du Bousquier's proffered hand in
marriage, and another check of the same nature which he experienced at
first from Mlle. Cormon. By a dexterous move in 1824 Chesnel succeeded
in rescuing Victurnien d'Esgrignon, though guilty, from the Court of
Assizes. The old notary succumbed soon after this event. [The Seamy
Side of History. Jealousies of a Country Town.]

CHESSEL (De), owner of the chateau and estate of Frapesle near Sache
in Touraine. Friend of the Vandenesses; he introduced their son Felix
to his neighbors, the Mortsaufs. The son of a manufacturer named
Durand who became very rich during the Revolution, but whose plebeian

only heiress of the Chessels, an old parliamentary family. M. de
Chessel was director-general and twice deputy. He received the title
of count under Louis XVIII. [The Lily of the Valley.]

CHESSEL (Madame de), wife of the preceding. She made up elaborate

Provincial at whose home the retired dancer Tullia, now Mme. du Bruel,
was fortunate to pass a summer in a rather hypocritical religious
penance. [A Prince of Bohemia.]

CHOCARDELLE (Mademoiselle), known as Antonia; a Parisian courtesan
during the reign of Louis Philippe; born in 1814. Maxime de Trailles
spoke of her as a woman of wit; "She's a pupil of mine, indeed," said
he. About 1834, she lived on rue Helder and for fifteen days was the
mistress of M. de la Palferine. [Beatrix. A Prince of Bohemia.] For a
time she operated a reading-room that M. de Trailles had established
for her on rue Coquenard. Like Marguerite Turquet she had "well soaked
the little d'Esgrignon." [A Man of Business.] In 1838 she was present
at the "house-warming" to Josepha Mirah on rue de la Ville-l'Eveque.
[Cousin Betty.] In 1839 she accompanied her lover Maxime de Trailles
to Arcis-sur-Aube to aid him in his official transactions relating to

widow Bridau to her home to celebrate the return of her elder son
Philippe from Texas. He posed as a Roman senator in a historic
picture. The painter Joseph Bridau was a friend of his. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.] About 1822 Chrestien fought a duel with Lucien Chardon
de Rubempre on account of Daniel d'Arthez. He was a great though
unknown statesman. He was killed at Saint-Merri cloister on June 6,
1832, where he was defending ideas not his own. [A Distinguished
Provincial at Paris.] He became foolishly enamored of Diane de
Maufrigneuse, but did not confess his love save by a letter addressed
to her just before he went to his death at the barricade. He had saved
the life of M. de Maufrigneuse in the Revolution of July, 1830,
through love for the duchesse. [The Secrets of a Princess.]

CHRISTEMIO, creole and foster-father of Paquita Valdes, whose
protector and body-guard he constituted himself. The Marquis de San-
Real caused his death for having abetted the intimacy between Paquita

Saint-Genevieve, Paris, in 1819. He alone was with Rastignac at the
funeral of Goriot, accompanying the body as far as Pere-Lachaise in
the priest's carriage. [Father Goriot.]

CIBOT, alias Galope-Chopine, also called Cibot the Great. A Chouan
implicated in the Breton insurrection of 1799. Decapitated by his
cousin Cibot, alias Pille-Miche, and by Marche-a-Terre for having
unthinkingly betrayed the brigand position to the "Blues." [The
Chouans.]

CIBOT (Barbette), wife of Cibot, alias Galope-Chopine. She went over
to the "Blues" after her husband's execution, and vowed through
vengeance to devote her son, who was still a child, to the Republican
cause. [The Chouans.]

CIBOT (Jean), alias Pille-Miche; one of the Chouans of the Breton
insurrection of 1799; cousin of Cibot, alias Galope-Chopine, and his
murderer. Pille-Miche it was, also, who shot and killed Adjutant
Gerard of the 72d demi-brigade at the Vivetiere. [The Chouans.]
Signalized as the hardiest of the indirect allies of the brigands in
the affair of the "Chauffeurs of Mortagne." Tried and executed in
1809. [The Seamy Side of History.]

CIBOT, born in 1786. From 1818 to 1845 he was tailor-janitor in a
house in rue de Normandie, belonging to Claude-Joseph Pillerault,
where dwelt Pons and Schmucke, the two musicians, time of Louis
Philippe. Poisoned by the pawn-broker Remonencq, Cibot died at his
post in April, 1845, on the same day of Sylvain Pons' demise. [Cousin
Pons.]

CIBOT (Madame). (See Remonencq, Madame.)

CICOGNARA, Roman Cardinal in 1758; protector of Zambinella. He caused
the assassination of Sarrasine who otherwise would have slain
Zambinella. [Sarrasine.]

CINQ-CYGNE, the name of an illustrious family of Champagne, the
younger branch of the house of Chargeboeuf. These two branches of the
same stock had a common origin in the Duineffs of the Frankish people.
The name of Cinq-Cygne arose from the defence of a castle made, in the
absence of their father, by five (/cinq/) daughters all remarkably
fair. On the blazon of the house of Cinq-Cygne is placed for device
the response of the eldest of the five sisters when summoned to
surrender: "We die singing!" [The Gondreville Mystery.]

CINQ-CYGNE (Comtesse de), mother of Laurence de Cinq-Cygne. Widow at
the time of the Revolution. She died in the height of a nervous fever
induced by an attack on her chateau at Troyes by the populace in 1793.
[The Gondreville Mystery.]

CINQ-CYGNE (Marquis de), name of Adrien d'Hauteserre after his
marriage with Laurence de Cinq-Cygne. (See Hauteserre, Adrien d'.)

CINQ-CYGNE (Laurence, Comtesse, afterwards Marquise de), born in 1781.
Left an orphan at the age of twelve, she lived, at the last of the
eighteenth and the first of the nineteenth century, with her kinsman
and tutor M. d'Hauteserre at Cinq-Cygne, Aube. She was loved by both
her cousins, Paul-Marie and Marie-Paul de Simeuse, and also by the
younger of her tutor's two sons, Adrien d'Hauteserre, whom she married
in 1813. Laurence de Cinq-Cygne struggled valiantly against a cunning
and redoubtable police-agency, the soul of which was Corentin. The
King of France approved the charter of the Count of Champagne, by
virtue of which, in the family of Cinq-Cygne, a woman might "ennoble
and succeed"; therefore the husband of Laurence took the name and the
arms of his wife. Although an ardent Royalist she went to seek the
Emperor as far as the battlefield of Jena, in 1806, to ask pardon for
the two Simeuses and the two Hauteserres involved in a political trial
and condemned to hard labor, despite their innocence. Her bold move
succeeded. The Marquise de Cinq-Cygne gave her husband two children,
Paul and Berthe. This family passed the winter season at Paris in a
magnificent mansion on Faubourg du Roule. [The Gondreville Mystery.]
In 1832 Mme. de Cinq-Cygne, at the instance of the Archbishop of
Paris, consented to call on the Princesse de Cadignan who had
reformed. [The Secrets of a Princess.] In 1836 Mme. de Cinq-Cygne was
intimate with Mme. de la Chanterie. [The Seamy Side of History.] Under
the Restoration, and principally during Charles X.'s reign, Mme. de
Cinq-Cygne exercised a sort of sovereignty over the Department of the
Aube which the Comte de Gondreville counterbalanced in a measure by
his family connections and through the generosity of the department.
Some time after the death of Louis XVIII. she brought about the
election of Francois Michu as president of the Arcis Court. [The
Member for Arcis.]

CINQ-CYGNE (Jules de), only brother of Laurence de Cinq-Cygne. He
emigrated at the outbreak of the Revolution and died for the Royalist
cause at Mayence. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

CINQ-CYGNE (Paul de), son of Laurence de Cinq-Cygne and of Adrien
d'Hauteserre; he became marquis after his father's death. [The
Gondreville Mystery.]

CINQ-CYGNE (Berthe de). (See Maufrigneuse, Mme. Georges de.)

CIPREY of Provins, Seine-et-Marne; nephew of the maternal grandmother
of Pierrette Lorrain. He formed one of the family council called
together in 1828 to decide whether or not the young girl should remain
underneath Denis Rogron's roof. This council replaced Rogron with the
notary Auffray and chose Ciprey for vice-guardian. [Pierrette.]

CLAES-MOLINA (Balthazar), Comte de Nourho; born at Douai in 1761 and
died in the same town in 1832; sprung from a famous family of Flemish
weavers, allied to a very noble Spanish family, time of Philip II. In
1795 he married Josephine de Temninck of Brussels, and lived happily
with her until 1809, at which time a Polish officer, Adam de
Wierzchownia, seeking shelter at the Claes mansion, discussed with him
the subject of chemical affinity. From that time on Balthazar, who
formerly had worked in Lavoisier's laboratory, buried himself
exclusively in the "quest of the absolute." He expended seven millions
in experiments, leaving his wife to die of neglect. From 1820 to 1825*
he was a tax-collector in Brittany--duties performed by his elder
daughter who had secured the position for him in order to divert him
from his barren labors. During this time she rehabilitated the family
fortunes. Balthazar died, almost insane, crying "Eureka!" [The Quest
of the Absolute.]

*   Given erroneously in original text as 1852.--J.W.M.

CLAES (Josephine de Temninck, Madame), wife of Balthazar Claes; born
at Brussels in 1770, died at Douai in 1816; a native Spaniard on her
mother's side; commonly called Pepita. She was small, crooked and
lame, with heavy black hair and glowing eyes. She gave her husband
four children: Marguerite, Felicie, Gabriel (or Gustave) and Jean-
Balthazar. She was passionatley devoted to her husband, and died of
grief over his neglect of her for the scientific experiments which
never came to an end. [The Quest of the Absolute.] Mme. Claes counted
among her kin the Evangelistas of Bordeau. [A Marriage Settlement.]

CLAES (Marguerite), elder daughter of Balthazar Claes and Josephine de
Temninck. (See Solis, Madame de.)

CLAES (Felicie), second daughter of Balthazar Claes and of Josephine
de Temninck; born in 1801. (See Pierquin, Madame.)

CLAES (Gabriel or Gustave), third child of Balthazar Claes and of
Josephine de Temninck; born about 1802. He attended the College of
Douai, afterwards entering the Ecole Polytechnique, becoming an
engineer of roads and bridges. In 1825 he married Mlle. Conyncks of
Cambrai. [The Quest of the Absolute.]

CLAES (Jean-Balthazar) last child of Balthazar Claes and Josephine de
Temninck; born in the early part of the nineteenth century. [The Quest
of the Absolute.]

CLAGNY (J.-B. de), public prosecutor at Sancerre in 1836. A passionate
admirer of Dinah de la Baudraye. He got transferred to Paris when she
returned there, and became successively the substitute for the general
prosecutor, attorney-general and finally attorney-general to the Court
of Cassation. He watched over and protected the misguided woman,
consenting to act as godfather to the child she had by Lousteau. [The
Muse of the Department.]

CLAGNY (Madame de), wife of the preceding. To use an expression of M.
Gravier's, she was "ugly enough to chase a young Cossack" in 1814.
Mme. de Clagny associated with Mme. de la Baudraye. [The Muse of the
Department.]

CLAPARON, clerk for the Minister of the Interior under the Republic
and Empire. Friend of Bridau, Sr., after whose death he continued his
cordial relations with Mme. Bridau. He gave much attention to Philippe
and Joseph on their mother's account. Claparon died in 1820. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

CLAPARON (Charles), son of the preceding; born about 1790. Business
man and banker (rue de Provence); at first a commercial traveler; an
aide of F. du Tillet in transactions of somewhat shady nature. He was
invited to the famous ball given by Cesar Birotteau in honor of
Cesar's nomination to the Legion of Honor and the release of French
possessions. [A Bachelor's Establishment. Cesar Birotteau.] In 1821,
at the Bourse in Paris, he made a peculiar bargain with the cashier
Castanier, who transferred to him, in exchange for his own
individuality, the power which he had received from John Melmoth, the
Englishman. [Melmoth Reconciled.] He was interested in the third
liquidation of Nucingen in 1826, a settlement which made the fortune
of the Alsatian banker whose "man of straw" he was for some time. [The
Firm of Nucingen.] He was associated with Cerizet who deceived him in
a deal about a house sold to Thuillier. Becoming bankrupt he embarked
for America about 1840. He was probably condemned for contumacy on
account of swindling. [A Man of Business. The Middle Classes.]

CLAPART, employe to the prefecture of the Seine during the
Restoration, at a salary of twelve hundred francs. Born about 1776.
About 1803 he married a widow Husson, aged twenty-two. At that time he
was employed in the Bureau of Finance, at a salary of eighteen hundred
francs and a promise of more. But his known incapacity held him down
to a secondary place. At the fall of the Empire he lost his position,
obtaining his new one on the recommendation of the Comte de Serizy.
Mme. Husson had by her first husband a child that was Clapart's evil
genius. In 1822 his family occupied an apartment renting for two
hundred and fifty francs at number seven rue de la Cerisaie. There he
saw much of the old pensioner Poiret. Clapart was killed by the
Fieschi attack of July 28, 1835. [A Start in Life.]

CLAPART (Madame), wife of the preceding; born in 1780; one of the
"Aspasias" of the Directory, and famous for her acquaintance with one
of the "Pentarques." He married her to Husson the contractor, who made
millions but who became bankrupt suddenly through the First Consul,
and suicided in 1802. At that time she was mistress of Moreau, steward
of M. de Serizy. Moreau was in love with her and would have made her
his wife, but just then was under sentence of death and a fugitive.
Thus it was that in her distress she married Clapart, a clerk in the
Bureau of Finance. By her first husband Mme. Clapart had a son, Oscar
Husson, whom she was bound up in, but whose boyish pranks caused her
much trouble. During the first Empire Mme. Clapart was a lady-in-
waiting to Mme. Mere--Letitia Bonaparte. [A Start in Life.]

CLARIMBAULT (Marechal de), maternal grandfather of Mme. de Beauseant.
He had married the daughter of Chevalier de Rastignac, great-uncle of
Eugene de Rastignac. [Father Goriot.]

CLAUDE, an idiot who died in the village of Dauphine in 1829, nursed
and metamorphosed by Dr. Benassis. [The Country Doctor.]

CLERETTI, an architect of Paris who was quite the fashion in 1843.
Grindot, though decadent at this time, tried to compete with him.
[Cousin Betty.]

CLERGET (Basine), laundress at Angouleme during the Restoration, who
succeeded Mme. Prieur with whom Eve Chardon had worked. Basine Clerget
concealed David Sechard and Kolb when Sechard was pursued by the
Cointet brothers. [Lost Illusions.]

CLOUSIER, retired attorney of Limoges; justice of the peace at
Montegnac after 1809. He was in touch with Mme. Graslin when she moved
there about 1830. An upright, phlegmatic man who finally led the
contemplative life of one of the ancient hermits. [The Country
Parson.]

COCHEGRUE (Jean), a Chouan who died of wounds received at the fight of
La Pelerine or at the siege of Fourgeres in 1799. Abbe Gudin said a
mass, in the forest, for the repose of Jean Cochegrue, and others
slain by the "Blues." [The Chouans.]

COCHET (Francoise), chambermaid of Modeste Mignon at Havre in 1829.
She received the answers to the letters addressed by Modeste to
Canalis. She had also faithfully served Bettina-Caroline, Modeste's
elder sister who took her to Paris. [Modeste Mignon.]

COCHIN (Emile-Louis-Lucien-Emmanuel), employe in Clergeot's division
of the Bureau of Finance during the Restoration. He had a brother who
looked after him in the administration. At this time Cochin was also a
silent partner in Matifat's drug-store. Colleville invented an anagram
on Cochin's name; with his given names it made up "Cochenille." Cochin
and his wife were in Birotteau's circle, being present with their son
at the famous ball given by the perfumer. In 1840, Cochin, now a
baron, was spoken of by Anselme Popinot as the oracle of the Lombard
and Bourdonnais quarters. [Cesar Birotteau. The Government Clerks. The
Firm of Nucingen. The Middle Classes.]

COCHIN, (Adolphe), son of the preceding; an employe of the Minister of
Finance as his father had been for some years. In 1826 his parents
tried to obtain for him the hand of Mlle. Matifat. [Cesar Birotteau.
The Firm of Nucingen.]

COFFINET, porter of a house belonging to Thuillier on rue Saint-
Dominique-d'Enfer, Paris, in 1840. His employer put him to work in
connection with the "Echo de la Bievre," when Louis-Jerome Thuillier
became editor-in-chief of this paper. [The Middle Classes.]

COFFINET, (Madame), wife of the preceding. She looked after Theodose
de la Peyrade's establishment. [The Middle Classes.]

COGNET, inn-keeper at Issoudun during the Restoration. House of the
"Knights of Idlesse" captained by Maxence Gilet. A former groom; born
about 1767; short, thickset, wife-led, one-eyed. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

COGNET (Madame), known as Mother Cognet, wife of the preceding; born
about 1783. A retired cook of a good house, who on account of her
"Cordon bleu" talents, was chosen to be the Leonarde of the Order
which had Maxence Gilet for chief. A tall, swarthy woman of
intelligent and pleasant demeanor. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

COINTET (Boniface), and his brother Jean, ran a thriving printing-
office at Angouleme during the Restoration. He ruined David Sechard's
shop by methods hardly honorable. Boniface Cointet was older than
Jean, and was usually called Cointet the Great. He put on the devout.
Extremely wealthy, he became deputy, was made a peer of France and
Minister of Commerce in Louis Philippe's coalition ministry. In 1842
he married Mlle. Popinot, daughter of Anselme Popinot. [Lost
Illusions. The Firm of Nucingen.] On May, 1839, he presided at the
sitting of the Chamber of Deputies when the election of Sallenauve was
ratified. [The Member for Arcis.]

COINTET (Jean), younger brother of the preceding; known as "Fatty"
Cointet; was foreman of the printing-office, while his brother ran the
business end. Jean Cointet passed for a good fellow and acted the
generous part. [Lost Illusions.]

COLAS (Jacques), a consumptive child of a village near Grenoble, who
was attended by Dr. Benassis. His passion was singing, for which he
had a very pure voice. Lived with his mother who was poverty-stricken.
Died in the latter part of 1829 at the age of fifteen, shortly after
the death of his benefactor, the physician. A nephew of Moreau, the
old laborer. [The Country Doctor.]

COLLEVILLE, son of a talented musician, once leading violin of the
Opera under Francoeur and Rebel. He himself was first clarionet at the
Opera-Comique, and at the same time chief clerk under the Minister of
Finance, and, in additon, book-keeper for a merchant from seven to
nine in the mornings. Great on anagrams. Made deputy-chief clerk in
Baudoyer's bureau when the latter was promoted to division chief. He
was preceptor at Paris six months later. In 1832 he became secretary
to the mayor of the twelfth Arrondissement and officer of the Legion
of Honor. At that time Colleville lived with his wife and family on
rue d'Enfer. He was Thuillier's most intimate friend. [The Government
Clerks. The Middle Classes.]

COLLEVILLE (Flavie Minoret, Madame), born in 1798; wife of the
preceding; daughter of a celebrated dancer and, supposedly, of M. du
Bourguier. She made a love match and between 1816 and 1826 bore five
children, each of whom resembled and may actually have had a different
father: 1st. A daughter born in 1816, who favored Colleville. 2d. A
son, Charles, cut out for a soldier, born during his mother's
acquaintance with Charles de Gondreville, under-lieutenant of the
dragoons of Saint-Chamans. 3d. A son, Francois, destined for business,
born during Mme. Colleville's intimacy with Francois Keller, the
banker. 4th. A daughter, Celeste born in 1821, of whom Thuillier,
Colleville's best friend, was the godfather--and father /in partibus/.
(See Phellion, Mme. Felix.) 5th. A son, Theodore, or Anatole, born at
a period of religious zeal. Madame Colleville was a Parisian, piquant,
winning and pretty, as well as clever and ethereal. She made her
husband very happy. He owed all his advancement to her. In the
interests of their ambition she granted momentary favor to Chardin des
Lupeaulx, the Secretary-General. On Wednesdays she was at home to
artists and distinguished people. [The Government Clerks. Cousin
Betty. The Middle Classes.]

COLLIN (Jacques), born in 1779. Reared by the Fathers of the Oratory.
He went as far as rhetoric, at school, and was then put in a bank by
his aunt, Jacqueline Collin. Accused, however, of a crime probably
committed by Franchessini, he fled the country. Later he was sent to
the galleys where he remained from 1810 to 1815, when he escaped and
came to Paris, stopping under the name of Vautrin at the Vauquer
pension. There he knew Rastignac, then a young man, became interested
in him, and tried to bring about his marriage with Victorine
Taillefer, for whom he procured a rich dowry by causing her brother to
be slain in a duel with Franchessini. Bibi-Lupin, chief of secret
police, arrested him in 1819 and returned him to the bagne, whence he
escaped again in 1820, reappearing in Paris as Carlos Herrera,
honorary canon of the Chapter of Toledo. At this time he rescued
Lucien de Rubempre from suicide, and took charge of the young poet.
Accused, with the latter, of having murdered Esther Gobseck, who in
truth was poisoned, Jacques Collin was acquitted of this charge, and
ended by becoming chief of secret police under the name of Saint-
Esteve, in 1830. He held this position till 1845. He finally became
wealthy, having an income of twelve thousand francs, three hundred
thousand francs inherited from Lucien de Rubempre, and the profits of
a green-leather manufactory at Gentilly. [Father Goriot. Lost
Illusions. A Distinguished Provincial at Paris. Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life. The Member for Arcis.] In addition to the pseudonym
of M. Jules, under which he was known by Catherine Goussard, Jacques
Collin also took for a time the English name of William Barker,
creditor for Georges d'Estourny. Under this name he hoodwinked the
cunning Cerizet, inducing that "man of business" to endorse some notes
for him. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] He was also nick-named
"Trompe-la-Mort."

COLLIN, (Jacqueline), aunt of Jacques Collin, whom she had reared;
born at Java. In her youth she was Marat's mistress, and afterwards
had relations with the chemist, Duvignon, who was condemned to death
for counterfeiting in 1799. During this intimacy she attained a
dangerous knowledge of toxicology. From 1800 to 1805 she was a
clothing dealer; and from 1806 to 1808 she spent two years in prison
for having influenced minors. From 1824 to 1830 Mlle. Collin exerted a
strong influence over Jacques, alias Vautrin, toward his life of
adventure without the pale of the law. Her strong point was disguises.
In 1839 she ran a matrimonial bureau on rue de Provence, under the
name of Mme. de Saint-Esteve. She often borrowed the name of her
friend Mme. Nourrisson, who, during the time of Louis Philippe, made a
pretence of business more or less dubious on rue Neuve-Saint-Marc. She
had some dealings with Victorin Hulot, at whose instance she brought
about the overthrow of Mme. Marneffe, mistress, and afterwards wife,
of Crevel. Under the name of Asie, Jacqueline Collin made an excellent
cook for Esther Gobseck, whom she was ordered by Vautrin to watch.
[Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. Cousin Betty. The Unconscious
Humorists.]

COLLINET, grocer at Arcis-sur-Aube, time of Louis Philippe. Elector
for the Liberals headed by Colonel Giguet. [The Member for Arcis.]

COLLINET (Francois-Joseph), merchant of Nantes. In 1814 the political
changes brought about his business failure. He went to America,
returning in 1824 enriched, and re-established. He had caused the loss
of twenty-four thousand francs to M. and Mme. Lorrain, small retailers
of Pen-Hoel, and father and mother of Major Lorrain. But, on his
return to France, he restored to Mme. Lorrain, then a widow and almost
a septuagenarian, forty-two thousand francs, being capital and
interest of his indebtedness to her. [Pierrette.]

COLONNA, aged Italian at Genoa, during the later part of the
eighteenth century. He had reared Luigia Porta under the name of
Colonna and as his own son, from the age of six until the time when
the young man enlisted in the French army. [The Vendetta.]

COLOQUINTE, given name of a pensioner who was "office boy" in Finot's
newspaper office in 1820. He had been through the Egyptian campaign,
losing an arm at the Battle of Montmirail. [A Bachelor's
Establishment. A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

COLORAT (Jerome), estate-keeper for Mme. Graslin at Montegnac; born at
Limoges. Retired soldier of the Empire; ex-sergeant in the Royal
Guard; at one time estate-keeper for M. de Navarreins, before entering
Mme. Graslin's service. [The Country Parson.]

CONSTANCE, chambermaid for Mme. de Restaud in 1819. Through her old
Goriot knew about everything that was going on at the home of his
elder daughter. This Constance, sometimes called Victorie, took money
to her mistress when the latter needed it. [Father Goriot.]

CONSTANT DE REBECQUE (Benjamin), born at Lausanne in 1767, died at
Paris, December 8, 1830. About the end of 1821 he is discovered in
Dauriat's book-shop at Palais-Royal, where Lucien de Rubempre noticed
his splendid head and spiritual eyes. [A Distinguished Provincial at
Paris.]

CONTI (Gennaro), musical composer; of Neapolitan origin, but born at
Marseilles. Lover of Mlle. des Touches--Camille Maupin--in 1821-1822.
Afterwards he paid court to Marquise Beatrix de Rochefide. [Lost
Illusions. Beatrix.]

CONYNCKS, family of Bruges, who were maternal ancestors of Marguerite
Claes. In 1812 this young girl at sixteen was the living image of a
Conyncks, her grandmother whose portrait hung in Balthazar Claes'
home. A Conyncks, also of Bruges but later established at Cambrai, was
granduncle of the children of Balthazar Claes, and was appointed their
vice-guardian after the death of Mme. Claes. He had a daughter who
married Gabriel Claes. [The Quest of the Absolute.]

COQUELIN (Monsieur and Madame), hardware dealers, successors to
Claude-Joseph Pillerault in a store on quai de la Ferraille, sign of
the Golden Bell. Guests at the big ball given by Cesar Birotteau.
After getting the invitation, Mme. Coquelin ordered a magnificent gown
for the occasion. [Cesar Birotteau.]

COQUET, chief of bureau to the Minister of War, in Lebrun's division
in 1838. Marneffe was his successor. Coquet had been in the service of
the administration since 1809, and had given perfect satisfaction. He
was a married man and his wife was still living at the time when he
was displaced. [Cousin Betty.]

CORALIE (Mademoiselle), actress at the Panorama-Dramatique and at the
Theatre du Gymnase, Paris, time of Louis XVIII. Born in 1803 and
brought up a Catholic, she was nevertheless of distinct Jewish type.
She died in August, 1822. Her mother sold her at fifteen to young
Henri de Marsay, whom she abhorred and who soon deserted her. She was
then maintained by Camusot, who was not obnoxious. She fell in love
with Lucien de Rubempre at first sight, surrendering to him
immediately and being faithful to him until her dying breath. The
glory and downfall of Coralie dated from this love. An original
criticism of the young Chardon established the success of "L'Alcade
dans l'Embarras," at the Marais, and brought to Coralie, one of the
principals in the play, an engagement at Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle,
with a salary of twelve thousand francs. But here the artist stranded,
the victim of a cabal, despite the protection of Camille Maupin. At
first she was housed on rue de Vendome, afterwards in a more modest
lodging where she died, attended and nursed by her cousin, Berenice.
She had sold her elegant furniture to Cardot, Sr., on leaving the
apartment on rue de Vendome, and in order to avoid moving it, he
installed Florentine there. Coralie was the rival of Mme. Perrin and
of Mlle. Fleuriet, whom she resembled and whose destiny should have
been her own. The funeral service of Coralie took place at noon in the
little church of Notre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle. Camusot promised to
purchase a plot of ground for her in the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise. [A
Start in Life. A Distinguished Provincial at Paris. A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

CORBIGNY (De), prefect of Loire-et-Cher, in 1811. Friend of Mme. de
Stael who authorized him to place Louis Lambert, at her expense, in
the College of Vendome. He probably died in 1812. [Louis Lambert.]

CORBINET, notary at Soulanges, Burgundy, in 1823, and at one time an
old patron of Sibilet's. The Gravelots, lumber dealers, were clients
of his. Commissioned with the sale of Aigues, when General de
Montcornet became wearied with developing his property. At one time
known as Corbineau. [The Peasantry.]

CORBINET, court-judge at Ville-aux-Fayes in 1823; son of Corbinet the
notary. He belonged, body and soul, to Gaubertin, the all-powerful
mayor of the town. [The Peasantry.]

CORBINET, retired captain, postal director at Ville-aux-Fayes in 1823;
brother of Corbinet, the notary. The last daughter of Sibilet, the
copy-clerk, was engaged to him when she was sixteen. [The Peasantry.]

CORENTIN, born at Vendome in 1777; a police-agent of great genius,
trained by Peyrade as Louis David was by Vien. A favorite of Fouche's
and probably his natural son. In 1799 he accompanied Mlle. de Verneuil
sent to lure and betray Alphonse de Montauran, the young chief of the
Bretons who were risen against the Republic. For two years Corentin
was attached to this strange girl as a serpent to a tree. [The
Chouans.] In 1803 he and his chief, Peyrade, were entrusted with a
difficult mission in the department of Aube, where he had to search
the home of Mlle. de Cinq-Cygne. She surprised him at the moment when
he was forcing open a casket, and struck him a blow with her riding
whip. This he avenged cruelly, involving, despite their innocence, the
Hauteserres and the Simeuses, friends and cousins of the young girl.
This was during the affair of the abduction of Senator Malin. About
the same time he concluded another delicate mission to Berlin to the
satisfaction of Talleyrand, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. [The
Gondreville Mystery.] From 1824 to 1830, Corentin was pitted against
the terrible Jacques Collin, alias Vautrin, whose friendly plans in
behalf of Lucien de Rubempre he thwarted so cruelly. Corentin it was
who rendered futile the contemplated marriage of the aspirant with
Clotilde de Grandlieu, bringing about as a consequence the absolute
ruin of the "distinguished provincial at Paris." He rusticated at
Passy, rue des Vignes, about May, 1830. Under Charles X., Corentin was
chief of the political police of the chateau. [Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.] For more than thirty years he lived on rue Honore-
Chevalier under the name of M. du Portail. He sheltered Lydie,
daughter of his friend, Peyrade, after the death of the old police-
agent. About 1840 he brought about her marriage with Theodose de la
Peyrade, nephew of Peyrade, after having upset the plans of the very
astute young man, greatly in love with Celeste Colleville's dowry.
Corentin--M. du Portail--then installed the chosen husband of his
adopted child into his own high official duties. [The Middle Classes.]

CORMON (Rose-Marie-Victoire). (See Bousquier, Madame du.)

CORNEVIN, an old native of Perche; foster-father of Olympe Michaud. He
was with the Chouans in 1794 and 1799. In 1823 he was servant at
Michaud's. [The Peasantry.]

CORNOILLER (Antoine), game-keeper at Saumur; married the sturdy Nanon
then fifty-nine years old, after the death of Grandet, about 1827, and
became general overseer of lands and properties of Eugenie Grandet.
[Eugenie Grandet.]

CORNOILLER (Madame). (See Nanon.)

COTTEREAU, well-known smuggler, one of the heads of the Breton
insurrection. In 1799 he was principal in a rather stormy scene at the
Vivetiere, when he threatened the Marquis de Montauran with swearing
allegiance to the First Consul if he did not immediately obtain
noteworthy advantages in payment of seven years of devoted service to
"the good cause." "My men and I have a devilish importunate creditor,"
said he, slapping his stomach. One of the brothers of Jean Cottereau,
was nick-named the "Chouan," a title used by all the Western rebels
against the Republic. [The Chouans.]

COTTIN (Marechal), Prince of Wissembourg; Duke of Orfano; old soldier
of the Republic and the Empire; Minister of War in 1841; born in 1771.
He was obliged to bring great shame upon his old friend and companion-
in-arms, Marshal Hulot, by advising him of the swindling of the
commissariat, Hulot d'Ervy. Marshal Cottin and Nucingen were witnesses
at the wedding of Hortense Hulot and Wenceslas Steinbock. [Cousin
Betty.]

COTTIN (Francine), a Breton woman, probably born at Fougeres in 1773;
chambermaid and confidante of Mlle. de Verneuil, who had been reared
by Francine's parents. Childhood's friend of Marche-a-Terre, with whom
she used her influence to save the life of her mistress during the
massacre of the "Blues" at the Vivitiere in 1799. [The Chouans.]

COUDRAI (Du), register of mortgages at Alencon, time of Louis XVIII. A
caller at the home of Mlle. Cormon, and afterwards at that of M. du
Bousquier, who married "the old maid." One of the town's most open-
hearted men; his only faults were having married a rich old lady who
was unendurable, and the habit of making villainous puns at which he
was first to laugh. In 1824 M. du Coudrai was poverty-stricken; he had
lost his place on account of voting the wrong way. [Jealousies of a
Country Town.]

COUPIAU, Breton courier from Mayenne to Fougeres in 1799. In the
struggle between the "Blues" and the Chouans he took no part, but
acted as circumstances demanded and for his own interests. Indeed he
offered no resistance when the "Brigands" stole the government chests.
Coupiau was nick-named Mene-a-Bien by Marche-a-Terre the Chouan. [The
Chouans.]

COUPIAU (Sulpice), Chouan and probably the father of Coupiau the
messenger. Killed in 1799 in the battle of La Pelerine or at the seige
of Fougeres. [The Chouans.]

COURAND (Jenny), florist; mistress of Felix Gaudissart in 1831. At
that time she lived in Paris on rue d'Artois. [Gaudissart the Great.]

COURCEUIL (Felix), of Alencon, retired army surgeon of the Rebel
forces of the Vendee. In 1809 he furnished arms to the "Brigands."
Involved in the trial known as "Chauffeurs of Mortagne." Condemned to
death for contumacy. [The Seamy Side of History.]

COURNANT, notary at Provins in 1827; rival of Auffray, the notary; of
the Opposition; one of the few public-spirited men of the little town.
[Pierrette.]

COURTECUISSE, game-keeper of the Aigues estate in Burgundy under the
Empire and Restoration until 1823. Born about 1777; at first in the
service of Mlle. Laguerre; discharged by General de Montcornet for
absolute incapacity, and replaced by keepers who were trusty and true.
Courtecuisse was a little fellow with a face like a full moon. He was
never so happy as when idle. On leaving he demanded a sum of eleven
hundred francs which was not due him. His master indignantly denied
his claim at first, but yielded the point, however, on being
threatened with a lawsuit, the scandal of which he wished to avoid.
Courtecuisse, out of a job, purchased from Rigou for two thousand
francs the little property of La Bachelerie, enclosed in the Aigues
estate, and wearied himself, without gain, in the management of his
land. He had a daughter who was tolerably pretty and eighteen years
old in 1823. At this time she was in the service of Mme. Mariotte the
elder, at Auxerre. Courtecuisse was given the sobriquet of
"Courtebotte"--short-boot. [The Peasantry.]

COURTECUISSE (Madame), wife of the preceding; in abject fear of the
miser, Gregoire Rigou, mayor of Blangy, Burgundy. [The Peasantry.]

COURTEVILLE (Madame de), cousin of Comte de Bauvan on the maternal
side; widow of a judge of the Seine Court. She had a very beautiful
daughter, Amelie, whom the comte wished to marry to his secretary,
Maurice de l'Hostal. [Honorine.]

COURTOIS, Marsac miller, near Angouleme during the Restoration. In
1821 rumor had it that he intended to wed a miller's widow, his
patroness, who was thirty-two years old. She had one hundred thousand
francs in her own right. David Sechard was advised by his father to
ask the hand of this rich widow. At the end of 1822 Courtois, now
married, sheltered Lucien de Rubempre, returning almost dead from
Paris. [Lost Illusions.]

COURTOIS (Madame), wife of the preceding, who cared sympathetically
for Lucien de Rubempre, on his return. [Lost Illusions.]

COUSSARD (Laurent). (See Goussard, Laurent.)

COUTELIER, a creditor of Maxime de Trailles. The Coutelier credit,
purchased for five hundred francs by the Claparon-Cerizet firm, came
to thirty-two hundred francs, seventy-five centimes, capital, interest
and costs. It was recovered by Cerizet by means of a strategy worthy
of a Scapin. [A Man of Business.]

COUTURE, a kind of financier-journalist of an equivocal reputation;
born about 1797. One of Mme. Schontz's earliest friends; and she alone
remained faithful to him when he was ruined by the downfall of the
ministry of March 1st, 1840. Couture was always welcome at the home of
the courtesan, who dreamed, perhaps, of making him her husband. But he
presented Fabien du Ronceret to her and the "lorette" married him. In
1836, in company with Finot and Blondet, he was present in a private
room of a well-known restaurant when Jean-Jacques Bixiou related the
origin of the Nucingen fortune. At the time of his transient wealth
Couture splendidly maintained Jenny Cadine. At one time he was
celebrated for his waistcoats. He had no known relationship with the
widow Couture. [Beatrix. The Firm of Nucingen.] The financier drew
upon himself the hatred of Cerizet for having deceived him in a deal
about the purchase of lands and houses situated in the suburbs of the
Madeleine, an affair in which Jerome Thuillier was afterwards
concerned. [The Middle Classes.]

COUTURE (Madame), widow of an ordonnance-commissary of the French
Republic. Relative and protectress of Mlle. Victorine Taillefer with
whom she lived at the Vauquer pension, in 1819. [Father Goriot.]

COUTURIER (Abbe), curate of Saint-Leonard church at Alencon, time of
Louis XVIII. Spiritual adviser of Mlle. Cormon, remaining her
confessor after her marriage with Du Bousquier, and influencing her in
the way of excessive penances. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

CREMIERE, tax-collector at Nemours during the Restoration. Nephew by
marriage of Dr. Minoret, who had secured the position for him,
furnishing his security. One of the three collateral heirs of the old
physician, the two others being Minoret-Levrault, the postmaster, and
Massin-Levrault, copy-clerk to the justice of the peace. In the
curious branching of these four Gatinais bourgeois families--the
Minorets, the Massins, the Levraults and the Cremieres--the tax
collector belonged to the Cremiere-Cremiere branch. He had several
children, among others a daughter named Angelique. After the
Revolution of July, 1830, he became municipal councillor. [Ursule
Mirouet.]

CREMIERE (Madame), nee Massin-Massin, wife of the tax-collector, and
niece of Dr. Minoret--that is, daughter of the old physician's sister.
A stout woman with a muddy blonde complexion splotched with freckles.
Passed for an educated person on account of her novel-reading. Her
/lapsi linguoe/ were maliciously spread abroad by Goupil, the notary's
clerk, who labelled them, "Capsulinguettes"; indeed, Mme. Cremiere
thus translated the two Latin words. [Ursule Mirouet.]

CREMIERE-DIONIS, always called Dionis, which name see.

CREVEL (Celestin), born between 1786 and 1788; clerked for Cesar
Birotteau the perfumer--first as second clerk, then as head-clerk when
Popinot left the house to set up in business for himself. After his
patron's failure in 1819, he purchased for five thousand seven hundred
francs, "The Queen of Roses," making his own fortune thereby. During
the reign of Louis Philippe he lived on his income. Captain, then
chief of battalion in the National Guard; officer of the Legion of
Honor; mayor of one of the arrondissements of Paris, he ended up by
being a very great personage. He had married the daughter of a farmer
of Brie; became a widower in 1833, when he gave himself over to a life
of pleasure. He maintained Josepha, who was taken away from him by his
friend, Baron Hulot. To avenge himself he tried to win Mme. Hulot. He
"protected" Heloise Brisetout. Finally he was smitten with Mme.
Marneffe, whom he had for mistress and afterwards married when she
became a widow in 1843. In May of this same year, Crevel and his wife
died of a horrible disease which had been communicated to Valerie by a
negro belonging to Montes the Brazilian. In 1838 Crevel lived on rue
des Saussaies; at the same time he owned a little house on rue du
Dauphin, where he had prepared a secret chamber for Mme. Marneffe;
this last house he leased to Maxime de Trailles. Besides these Crevel
owned: a house on rue Barbet de Jouy; the Presles property bought of
Mme. de Serizy at a cost of three million francs. He caused himself to
be made a member of the General Council of Seine-et-Oise. By his first
marriage he had an only daughter, Celestine, who married Victorin
Hulot. [Cesar Birotteau. Cousin Betty.] In 1844-1845 Crevel owned a
share in the management of the theatre directed by Gaudissart. [Cousin
Pons.]

CREVEL (Celestine), only child of the first marriage of the preceding.
(See Hulot, Mme. Victorin.)

CREVEL (Madame Celestin), born Valerie Fortin in 1815; natural
daughter of the Comte de Montcornet, marshal of France; married, first
Marneffe, an employe in the War Office, with whom she broke faith by
agreement with the clerk; and second, Celestin Crevel. She bore
Marneffe a child, a stunted, scrawny urchin named Stanislas. An
intimate friend of Lisbeth Fischer who utilized Valerie's irresistible
attractions for the satisfying of her hatred towards her rich
relatives. At this time Mme. Marneffe belonged jointly to Marneffe, to
the Brazilian Montes, to Steinbock the Pole, to Celestin Crevel and to
Baron Hulot. Each of these she held responsible for a child born in
1841, and which died on coming into the world. By prearrangement, she
was surprised with Hulot by the police-commissioners, during this
period, in Crevel's cottage on rue du Dauphin. After having lived with
Marneffe on rue du Doyenne in the house occuped by Lisbeth Fischer--
"Cousin Betty"--she was installed by Baron Hulot on rue Vaneau; then
by Crevel in a mansion on rue Barbet-de-Jouy. She died in 1843, two
days prior to Celestin. She perished while trying to "cajole God"--to
use her own expression. She bequeathed, as a restitution, 300,000
francs to Hector Hulot. Valerie Marneffe did not lack spirit. Claude
Vignon, the great critic, especially appreciated this woman's
intellectual depravity. [Cousin Betty.]

CROCHARD, Opera dancer in the second half of the eighteenth century.
Director of theatrical evolutions. He commanded a band of assailants
upon the Bastile, July 14, 1789; became an officer, a colonel, dying
of wounds received at Lutzen, May 2, 1813. [A Second Home.]

CROCHARD (Madame), widow of the preceding. Before the Revolution she
had sung with her husband in the chorus. In 1815 she lived wretchedly
with her daughter Caroline, following the embroiderer's trade, in a
house on rue du Tourniquet-Saint-Jean, which belonged to Molineux.
Wishing to find a protector for her daughter, Caroline, Mme. Crochard
favored the attentions of the Comte de Granville. He rewarded her with
a life-annuity of three thousand francs. She died, in 1822, in a
comfortable lodging on rue Saint-Louis at Marais. She constantly wore
on her breast the cross of chevalier of the Legion of Honor conferred
on her husband by the Emperor. The widow Crochard, watched by an eager
circle, received, at her last moments, a visit from Abbe Fontanon,
confessor of the Comtesse de Granville, and was greatly troubled by
the prelate's proceedings. [A Second Home.]

CROCHARD (Caroline), daughter of the proceding; born in 1797. For
several years during the Restoration she was the mistress of Comte de
Granville; at that time she was known as Mlle. de Bellefeuille, from
the name of a small piece of property at Gatinais given to the young
woman by an uncle of the comte who had taken a liking to her. Her
lover installed her in an elegant apartment on rue Taitbout, where
Esther Gobseck afterwards lived. Caroline Crochard abandoned M. de
Granville and a good position for a needy young fellow named Solvet,
who ran through with all her property. Sick and poverty-stricken in
1833, she lived in a wretched two-story house on rue Gaillon. She gave
the Comte de Granville a son, Charles, and a daughter, Eugenie. [A
Second Home.]

CROCHARD (Charles), illegitimate child of Comte de Granville and
Caroline Crochard. In 1833 he was apprehended for a considerable
theft, when he appealed to his father through the agency of Eugene de
Granville, his half-brother. The comte gave the latter money enough to
clear up the miserable business, if such were possible. [A Second
Home.] The theft in question was committed at the home of Mlle.
Beaumesnil. He carried off her diamonds. [The Middle Classes.]

CROISIER (Du). (See Bousquier, Du.)

CROIZEAU, former coachmaker to Bonaparte's Imperial court; had an
income of about forty thousand francs; lived on rue Buffault; a
widower without children. He was a constant visitor at Antonia
Chocardelle's reading-room on rue Coquenard, time of Louis Philippe,
and he offered to marry the "charming woman." [A Man of Business.]

CROTTAT (Monsieur and Madame), retired farmers; parents of the notary
Crottat, assassinated by some thieves, among them being the notorious
Dannepont, alias La Pouraille. The trial of this crime was called in
May, 1830. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] They were well-to-do folk
and, according to Cesar Birotteau who knew them, old man Crottat was
as "close as a snail." [Cesar Birotteau.]

CROTTAT (Alexandre), head-clerk of Maitre Roguin, and his successor in
1819, after the flight of the notary. He married the daughter of
Lourdois, the painting-contractor. Cesar Birotteau thought for a time
of making him his son-in-law. He called him, familiarly, "Xandrot."
Alexandre Crottat was a guest at the famous ball given by the perfumer
in December, 1818. He was in friendly relations with Derville, the
attorney, who commissioned him with a sort of half-pay for Colonel
Chabert. He was also Comtesse Ferraud's notary at this time. [Cesar
Birotteau. Colonel Chabert.] In 1822 he was notary to Comte de Serizy.
[A Start in Life.] He was also notary to Charles de Vandenesse; and
one evening, at the home of the marquis, he made some awkward
allusions which undoubtedly recalled unpleasant memories to his client
and Mme. d'Aiglemont. Upon his return home he narrated the particulars
to his wife, who chided him sharply. [A Woman of Thirty.] Alexandre
Crottat and Leopold Hannequin signed the will dictated by Sylvain Pons
on his death-bed. [Cousin Pons.]

CRUCHOT (Abbe), priest of Saumur; dignitary of the Chapter of Saint-
Martin of Tours; brother of Cruchot, the notary; uncle of President
Cruchot de Bonfons; the Talleyrand of his family; after much angling
he induced Eugenie Grandet to wed the president in 1827. [Eugenie
Grandet.]

CRUCHOT, notary at Saumur during the Restoration; brother of Abbe
Cruchot; uncle of President Cruchot de Bonfons. He as well as the
prelate was much concerned with making the match between his nephew
and Eugenie Grandet. The young girl's father entrusted M. Cruchot with
his usurious dealings and probably with all his money matters.
[Eugenie Grandet.]

CURIEUX (Catherine). (See Farrabesche, Madame.)

CYDALISE, magnificent woman of Valognes, Normandy, who launched out in
Paris in 1840 to make capital out of her beauty. Born in 1824, she was
then only sixteen. She served as an instrument for Montes the
Brazilian who, in order to avenge himself on Mme. Marneffe--now Mme.
Crevel--inoculated the young girl with a terrible disease through one
of his negroes. He in turn obtained it from Cydalise and transmitted
it to the faithless Valerie who died as also did her husband. Cydalise
probably accompanied Montes to Brazil, the only place where this
horrible ailment is curable. [Cousin Betty.]



D

DALLOT, mason in the suburbs of l'Isle-Adam in the early days of the
Restoration, who was to marry a peasant woman of small wit named
Genevieve. After having courted her for the sake of her little
property, he deserted her for a woman of more means and also of a
sharper intelligence. This separation was so cruel a blow to Genevieve
that she became idiotic. [Farewell.]

DANNEPONT, alias La Pouraille, one of the assassins of M. and Mme.
Crottat. Imprisoned for his crime in 1830 at the Conciergerie, and
under sentence of capital punishment; an escaped convict who had been
sought on account of other crimes by the police for five years past.
Born about 1785 and sent to the galleys at the age of nineteen. There
he had known Jacques Collin--Vautrin. Riganson, Selerier and he formed
a sort of triumvirate. A short, skinny, dried-up fellow with a face
like a marten. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

DAUPHIN, pastry-cook of Arcis-sur-Aube; well-known Republican. In
1830, in an electoral caucus, he questioned Sallenauve, a candidate
for deputy, about Danton. [The Member for Arcis.]

DAURIAT, editor and bookman of Paris, on Palais-Royale, Galleries de
Bois during the Restoration. He purchased for three thousand francs a
collection of sonnets "Marguerites" from Lucien de Rubempre, who had
scored a book of Nathan's. But he did not publish the sonnets until a
long time afterwards, and with a success that the author declared to
be posthumous. Dauriat's shop was the rendezvous of writers and
politicians of note at this time. [A Distinguished Provincial at
Paris. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] Dauriat, who was Canalis'
publisher, was asked in 1829 by Modeste Mignon for personal
information concerning the poet, to which he made a rather ironical
reply. In speaking of celebrated authors Dauriat was wont to say, "I
have made Canalis. I have made Nathan." [Modeste Mignon.]

DAVID (Madame), woman living in the outskirts of Brives, who died of
fright on account of the Chauffeurs, time of the Directory. [The
Country Parson.]

DELBECQ, secretary and steward of Comte Ferraud during the
Restoration. Retired attorney. A capable, ambitious man in the service
of the countess, whom he aided to rid herself of Colonel Chabert when
that officer claimed his former wife. [Colonel Chabert.]

DENISART, name assumed by Cerizet.

DERVILLE, attorney at Paris, rue Vivienne, from 1819 to 1840. Born in
1794, the seventh child of an insignificant bourgeois of Noyon. In
1816 he was only second clerk and dwelt on rue des Gres, having for a
neighbor the well-known usurer Gobseck, who later advanced him one
hundred and fifty thousand francs at 15 per cent., with which he
purchased the practice of his patron, a man of pleasure now somewhat
short of funds. Through Gobseck he met his future wife, Jenny Malvaut;
through the same man he learned the Restaud secrets. In the winter of
1829-1830 he told of their troubles to the Vicomtesse de Grandlieu.
Derville had re-established the fortune of the feminine representative
of the Grandlieu's younger branch, at the time of the Bourbon's
re-entry, and therefore was on a friendly footing at her home.
[Gobseck.] He had been a clerk at Bordin's. [A Start in Life. The
Gondreville Mystery.] He was attorney for Colonel Chabert who sought
his conjugal rights with Comtesse Ferraud. He became keenly interested
in the old officer, aiding him and being greatly grieved when, some
years later, he found him plunged into idiocy in the Bicetre hospital.
[Colonel Chabert.] Derville was also attorney for Comte de Serizy,
Mme. de Nucingen and the Ducs de Grandlieu and de Chaulieu, whose
entire confidence he possessed. In 1830, under the name of Saint-
Denis, he and Corentin inquired of the Sechards at Angouleme
concerning the real resources of Lucien de Rubempre. [Father Goriot.
Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

DERVILLE (Madame), born Jenny Malvaut; wife of Derville the attorney;
young Parisian girl, though born in the country. In 1826 she lived
alone, but maintaining a virtuous life, supported by her work. She was
on the fifth floor of a gloomy house on rue Montmartre, where Gobseck
had called to collect a note signed by her. He pointed her out to
Derville, who married her without a dowry. Later she inherited from an
uncle, a farmer who had become wealthy, seventy thousand francs with
which she aided her husband to cancel his debt with Gobseck.
[Gobseck.] Being anxious for an invitation to the ball given by
Birotteau, she paid a rather unexpected visit to the perfumer's wife.
She made much of the latter and of Mlle. Birotteau, and was invited
with her husband to the festivities. It appears that some years before
her marriage she had worked as dressmaker for the Birotteaus. [Cesar
Birotteau.]

DESCOINGS (Monsieur and Madame), father-in-law and mother-in-law of
Dr. Rouget of Issoudun. Dealers in wool, acting as selling agents for
owners, and buying agents for fleece merchants of Berry. They also
bought state lands. Rich and miserly. Died during the Republic within
two years of each other and before 1799. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

DESCOINGS, son of the preceding; younger brother of Mme. Rouget, the
doctor's wife; grocer at Paris, on rue Saint-Honore, not far from
Robespierre's quarters. Descoings had married for love the widow of
Bixiou, his predecessor. She was twelve years his senior but well
preserved and "plump as a thrush after harvest." Accused of
foreclosing, he was sent to the scaffold, in company with Andre
Chenier, on the seventh Thermidor of year 2, July 25, 1794. The death
of the grocer caused a greater sensation than did that of the poet.
Cesar Birotteau moved the plant of the perfumery "Queen of Roses" into
Descoings' shop around 1800. The successor of the executed man managed
his business badly; the inventor of the the "Eau Carminative" went
bankrupt. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

DESCOINGS (Madame), born in 1744; widow of two husbands, Bixiou and
Descoings, the latter succeeding the former in the grocer shop on rue
Saint-Honore, Paris. Grandmother of Jean-Jacques Bixiou, the
cartoonist. After the death of M. Bridau, chief of division in the
Department of the Interior, Mme. Descoings, now a widow, came in 1819
to live with her niece, the widow Bridau, nee Agathe Rouget, bringing
to the common fund an income of six thousand francs. An excellent
woman, known in her day as "the pretty grocer." She ran the household,
but had likewise a decided mania for lottery, and always for the same
numbers; she "nursed a trey." She ended by ruining her niece who had
blindly entrusted her interests to her, but Mme. Descoings repaid for
her foolish doings by an absolute devotion,--all the while continuing
to place her money on the evasive combinations. One day her hoardings
were stolen from her mattress by Philippe Bridau. On this account she
was unable to renew her lottery tickets. Then it was that the famous
trey turned up. Madame Descoings died of grief, December 31, 1821. Had
it not been for the theft she would have become a millionaire. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

DESFONDRILLES, substitute judge at Provins during the Restoration;
made president of the court of that town, time of Louis Philippe. An
old fellow more archaeologist than judge, who found delight in the
petty squabbles under his eyes. He forsook Tiphaine's party for the
Liberals headed by lawyer Vinet. [Pierrette.]

DESLANDES, surgeon of Azay-le-Rideau in 1817. Called in to bleed Mme.
de Mortsauf, whose life was saved by this operation. [The Lily of the
Valley.]

DESMARETS (Jules), Parisian stock-broker under the Restoration.
Hardworking and upright, being reared in sternness and poverty. When
only a clerk he fell in love with a charming young girl met at his
patron's home, and he married her despite the irregularity connected
with her birth. With the money he obtained by his wife's mother he was
able to purchase the position of the stock-broker for whom he had
clerked; and for several years he was very happy in a mutual love and
a liberal competence--an income of two hundred and fifty thousand
francs. In 1820 he and his wife lived in a large mansion on rue
Menars. In the early years of his wedded life he killed in a duel--
though unknown to his wife--a man who had vilified Mme. Desmarets. The
flawless happiness which abode with this well-mated couple was cut
short by the death of the wife, mortally wounded by a doubt, held for
a moment only by her husband, concerning her faithfulness. Desmarets,
bereaved, sold his place to Martin Falleix's brother and left Paris in
despair. [The Thirteen.] M. and Mme. Desmarets were invited to the
famous ball given by Cesar Birotteau in 1818. After the bankruptcy of
the perfumer, the broker kindly gave him useful tips about placing
funds laboriously scraped together towards the complete reimbursing of
the creditors. [Cesar Birotteau.]

DESMARETS (Madame Jules), wife of the preceding; natural daughter of
Bourignard alias Ferragus, and of a married woman who passed for her
godmother. She had no civil status, but when she married Jules
Desmarets her name, Clemence, and her age were publicly announced.
Despite herself, Mme. Desmarets was loved by a young officer of the
Royal Guard, Auguste de Maulincour. Mme. Desmaret's secret visits to
her father, a man of mystery, unknown to her husband, caused the
downfall of their absolute happiness. Desmarets thought himself
deceived, and she died on account of his suspicions, in 1820 or 1821.
The remains of Clemence were placed at first in Pere Lachaise, but
afterwards were disinterred, incinerated and sent to Jules Desmarets
by Bourignard, assisted by twelve friends who thus thought to dull the
edge of the keenest of conjugal sorrows. [The Thirteen.] M. and Mme.
Desmarets were often alluded to as M. and Mme. Jules. At the ball
given by Cesar Birotteau, Mme. Desmarets shone as the most beautiful
woman, according to the perfumer's wife herself. [Cesar Birotteau.]

DESMARETS, Parisian notary during the Restoration; elder brother of
the broker, Jules Desmarets. The notary was set up in business by his
younger brother and grew rich rapidly. He received his brother's will.
He accompanied him to Mme. Desmarets' funeral. [The Thirteen.]

DESPLEIN, famous surgeon of Paris, born about the middle of the
eighteenth century. Sprung of a poor provincial family, he spent a
youth full of suffering, being enabled to pass his examinations only
through assistance rendered him by his neighbor in poverty, Bourgeat
the water-carrier. For two years he lived with him on the sixth floor
of a wretched house on rue des Quatre-Vents, where later was
established the "Cenacle" with Daniel d'Arthez as host--on which
account the house came to be spoken of as the "bowl for great men."
Desplein, evicted by his landlord whom he could not pay, lodged next
with his friend the Auvergnat in the Court de Rohan, Passage du
Commerce. Afterwards, when an "intern" at Hotel-Dieu, he remembered
the good deeds of Bourgeat, nursed him as a devoted son, and, in the
time of the Empire, established in honor of this simple man who
professed religious sentiments a quarterly mass at Saint-Sulpice, at
which he piously assisted, though himself an outspoken atheist. [The
Atheist's Mass.] In 1806 Desplein had predicted speedy death for an
old fellow then fifty-six years old, but who was still alive in 1846.
[Cousin Pons.] The surgeon was present at the death caused by despair
of M. Chardon, an old military doctor. [Lost Illusions.] Desplein
attended the last hours of Mme. Jules Desmarets, who died in 1820 or
1821; also of the chief of division, Flamet de la Billardiere, who
died in 1824. [The Thirteen. The Government Clerks.] In March, 1828,
at Provins, he performed an operation of trepanning on Pierrette
Lorrain. [Pierrette.] In the same year he undertook a bold operation
upon Mme. Philippe Bridau whose abuse of strong drink had induced a
"magnificent malady" that he believed had disappeared. This operation
was reported in the "Gazette des Hopitaux;" but the patient died. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.] In 1829 Desplein was summoned on behalf of
Vanda de Mergi, daughter of Baron de Bourlac. [The Seamy Side of
History.] In the latter part of the same year he operated successfully
upon Mme. Mignon for blindness. In February, 1830, on account of the
foregoing, he was a witness at Modeste Mignon's wedding with Ernest de
la Briere. [Modeste Mignon.] In the beginning of the same yaer, 1830,
he was called by Corentin to visit Baron de Nucingen, love-sick for
Esther Gobseck; and Mme. de Serizy ill on account of the suicide of
Lucien de Rubempre. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] He and his
assistant, Bianchon, waited on Mme. de Bauvan, who was on the verge of
death at the close of 1830 and beginning of 1831. [Honorine.] Desplein
had an only daughter whose marriage in 1829 was arranged with the
Prince of Loudon.

DESROCHES, clerk of the Minister of the Interior under the Empire;
friend of Bridau Senior, who had procured him the position. He was
also on friendly terms with the chief's widow, at whose home he met,
nearly every evening, his colleagues Du Bruel and Claparon. A dry,
crusty man, who would never become sub-chief, despite his ability. He
earned only one thousand eight hundred francs by running a department
for stamped paper. Retired after the second return of Louis XVIII., he
talked of entering as chief of bureau into an insurance company with a
graduated salary. In 1821, despite his scarcely tender disposition,
Desroches undertook with much discretion and confidence to extricate
Philippe Bridau out of a predicament--the latter having made a "loan"
on the cash-box of the newspaper for which he was working; he brought
about his resignation without any scandal. Desroches was a man of good
"judgment." He remained to the last a friend of the widow Bridau after
the death of MM. du Bruel and Claparon. He was a persistent fisherman.
[A Bachelor's Establishment.]

DESROCHES (Madame), wife of the preceding. A widow, in 1826, she
sought the hand of Mlle. Matifat for her son, Desroches the attorney.
[The Firm of Nucingen.]

DESROCHES, son of the two foregoing; born about 1795, reared strictly
by a very harsh father. He went into Derville's office as fourth clerk
in 1818, and on the following year passed to the second clerkship. He
saw Colonel Chabert at Derville's. In 1821 or 1822 he purchased a
lawyer's office with bare title on rue de Bethizy. He was shrewd and
quick and therefore was not long in finding a clientele composed of
litterateurs, artists, actresses, famous lorettes and elegant
Bohemians. He was counsellor for Agathe and Joseph Bridau, and also
gave excellent advice to Philippe Bridau who was setting out for
Issoudun about 1822. [A Bachelor's Establishment. Colonel Chabert. A
Start in Life.] Desroches was advocate for Charles de Vandenesse,
pleading against his brother Felix; for the Marquise d'Espard, seeking
interdiction against her husband; and for the Secretary-General
Chardin des Lupeaulx, with whom he counseled astutely. [A Woman of
Thirty. The Commission in Lunacy. The Government Clerks.] Lucien de
Rubempre consulted Desroches about the seizure of the furniture of
Coralie, his mistress, in 1822. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]
Vautrin appreciated the attorney; he said that the latter would be
able to "recover" the Rubempre property, to improve it and make it
capable of yielding Lucien an income of thirty thousand francs, which
would probably have allowed him to wed Clotilde de Grandlieu. [Scenes
from a Courtesan's Life.] In 1826 Desroches made a short-lived attempt
to marry Malvina d'Aldrigger. [The Firm of Nucingen.] About 1840 he
related, at Mlle. Turquet's--Malaga's--home, then maintained by Cardot
the notary, and in the presence of Bixiou, Lousteau and Nathan, who
were invited by the tabellion, the tricks employed by Cerizet to
obtain the face value of a note out of Maxime de Trailles. [A Man of
Business.] Indeed, Desroches was Cerizet's lawyer when the latter had
a quarrel with Theodose de la Peyrade in 1840. He also looked after
the interests of the contractor, Sauvaignou, at the same time. [The
Middle Classes.] Desroches' office was probably located for a time on
rue de Buci. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

DESROYS, clerk with the Minister of Finance in Baudoyer's bureau,
under the Restoration. The son of a Conventionalist who had not
favored the King's death. A Republican; friend of Michel Chrestien. He
did not associate with any of his colleagues, but kept his manner of
life so concealed that none knew where he lived. In December, 1824, he
was discharged because of his opinions concerning the denunciation of
Dutocq. [The Government Clerks.]

DESROZIERS, musician; prize-winner at Rome; died in that city through
typhoid fever in 1836. Friend of the sculptor Dorlange, to whom he
recounted the story of Zambinella, the death of Sarrasine and the
marriage of the Count of Lanty. Desroziers gave music lessons to
Marianina, daughter of the count. The musician employed his friend,
who was momentarily in need of money, to undertake a copy of a statue
of Adonis, which reproduced Zambinella's features. This copy he sold
to M. de Lanty. [The Member for Arcis.]

DESROZIERS, printer at Moulins, department of the Allier. After 1830
he published a small volume containing the works of "Jan Diaz, son of
a Spanish prisoner, and born in 1807 at Bourges." This volume had an
introductory sketch on Jan Diaz by M. de Clagny. [The Muse of the
Department.]

DEY (Comtesse de), born about 1755. Widow of a lieutenant-general
retired to Carentan, department of the Manche, where she died suddenly
in November, 1793, through a shock to her maternal sensibilities. [The
Conscript.]

DEY (Auguste, Comte de), only son of Mme. de Dey. Made lieutenant of
the dragoons when only eighteen, and followed the princes in
emigration as a point of honor. He was idolized by his mother, who had
remained in France in order to preserve his fortune for him. He
participated in the Granville expedition. Imprisoned as a result of
this affair, he wrote Mme. de Dey that he would arrive at her home,
disguised and a fugitive, within three days' time. But he was shot in
the Morbihan at the exact moment when his mother expired from the
shock of having received instead of her son the conscript Julien
Jussieu. [The Conscript.]

DIARD (Pierre-Francois), born in the suburbs of Nice; the son of a
merchant-provost; quartermaster of the Sixth regiment of the line, in
1808, then chief of battalion in the Imperial Guard; retired with this
rank on account of a rather severe wound received in Germany;
afterwards an administrator and business man; excessive gambler.
Husband of Juana Mancini who had been the mistress of Captain
Montefiore, Diard's most intimate friend. In 1823, at Bordeaux, Diard
killed and robbed Montefiore, whom he met by accident. Upon his return
home he confessed his crime to his wife who vainly besought him to
commit suicide; and she herself finally blew out his brains with a
pistol shot. [The Maranas.]

DIARD (Maria-Juana-Pepita), daughter of La Marana, a Venetian
courtesan, and a young Italian nobleman, Mancini, who acknowledged
her. Wife of Pierre-Francois Diard whom she accepted on her mother's
request, after having given herself to Montefiore who did not wish to
marry her. Juana had been reared very strictly in the Spanish home of
Perez de Lagounia, at Tarragone, and she bore her father's name. She
was the descendant of a long line of courtesans, a feminine branch
that had never made legal marriages. The blood of her ancestors was in
her veins; she showed this involuntarily by the way in which she
yielded to Montefiore. Although she did not love her husband, yet she
remained entirely faithful to him, and she killed him for honor's
sake. She had two children. [The Maranas.]

DIARD (Juan), first child of Mme. Diard. Born seven months after his
mother's marriage, and perhaps the son of Montefiore. He was the image
of Juana, who secretly petted him extravagantly, although she
pretended to like her younger son the better. By a "species of
admirable flattery" Diard had made Juan his choice. [The Maranas.]

DIARD (Francisque), second son of M. and Mme. Diard, born in Paris. A
counterpart of his father, and the favorite--only outwardly--of his
mother. [The Maranas.]

DIAZ (Jan), assumed name of Mme. Dinah de la Baudraye.

DIODATI, owner of a villa on Lake Geneva in 1823-1824.--Character in a
novel called "L'Ambitieux par Amour" published by Albert Savarus in
the "Revue de l'Est" in 1834. [Albert Savarus.]

DIONIS, notary at Nemours from about 1813 till the early part of the
reign of Louis Philippe. He was a Cremiere-Dionis, but was always
known by the latter name. A shrewd, double-faced individual, who was
secretly a partner with Massin-Levrault the money-lender. He concerned
himself with the inheritance left by Dr. Minoret, giving advice to the
three legatees of the old physician. After the Revolution of 1830, he
was elected mayor of Nemours, instead of M. Levrault, and about 1837
he became deputy. He was then received at court balls, in company with
his wife, and Mme. Dionis was "enthroned" in the village because of
her "ways of the throne." The couple had at least one daughter.
[Ursule Mirouet.] Dionis breakfasted familiarly with Rastignac,
Minister of Public Works, from 1839 to 1845. [The Member for Arcis.]

DOGUEREAU, publisher on rue de Coq, Paris, in 1821, having been
established since the first of the century; retired professor of
rhetoric. Lucien de Rubempre offered him his romance, "The Archer of
Charles IX.," but the publisher would not give him more than four
hundred francs for it, so the trade was not concluded. [A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

DOISY, porter of the Lepitre Institution, quarter du Marais, Paris,
about 1814, at the time when Felix de Vandenesse came there to
complete his course of study. This young man contracted a debt of one
hundred francs on Doisy's account, which resulted in a very severe
reprimand from his mother. [The Lily of the Valley.]

DOMINIS (Abbe de), priest of Tours during the Restoration; preceptor
of Jacques de Mortsauf. [The Lily of the Valley.]

DOMMANGET, an accoucheur-physician, famous in Paris at the time of
Louis Philippe. In 1840 he was called in to visit Mme. Calyste du
Guenic, whom he had accouched, and who had taken a dangerous relapse
on learning of her husband's infidelity. She was nursing her son at
this time. On being taken into her confidence, Dommanget treated and
cured her ailment by purely moral methods. [Beatrix.]

DONI (Massimilla). (See Varese, Princesse de.)

DORLANGE (Charles), first name of Sallenauve, which name see.

DORSONVAL (Madame), bourgeoise of Saumur, acquainted with M. and Mme.
de Grassins at the time of the Restoration. [Eugenie Grandet.]

DOUBLON (Victor-Ange-Hermenegilde), bailiff at Angouleme during the
Restoration. He acted against David Sechard on behalf of the Cointet
brothers. [Lost Illusions.]

DUBERGHE, wine-merchant of Bordeaux from whom Nucingen purchased in
1815, before the battle of Waterloo, 150,000 bottles of wine,
averaging thirty sous to the bottle. The financier sold them for six
francs each to the allied armies, from 1817 to 1819. [The Firm of
Nucingen.]

DUBOURDIEU, born about 1805; a symbolic painter of the Fouierist
school; decorated. In 1845 he was met at the corner of rue Nueve-
Vivienne by his friend Leon de Lora, when he expressed his ideas on
art and philosophy to Gazonal and Bixiou, who were with the famous
landscape-painter. [The Unconscious Humorists.]

DUBUT of Caen, merchant connected with MM. de Boisfranc, de Boisfrelon
and de Boislaurier who were also Dubuts, and whose grandfather was a
dealer in linens. Dubut of Caen was involved in the trial of the
Chauffeurs of Mortagne, in 1809, and sentenced to death for contumacy.
During the Restoration, on account of his devotion to the Royal cause,
he had hoped to obtain the succession to the title of M. de Boisfranc.
Louis XVIII. made him grand provost, in 1815, and later public
prosecutor under the coveted name; finally he died as first president
of the court. [The Seamy Side of History.]

DUCANGE (Victor), novelist and playwright of France: born in 1783 at
La Haye; died in 1833; one of the collaborators on "Thirty Years," or
"A Gambler's Life," and the author of "Leonide." Victor Ducange was
present at Braulard's, the head-claquer's, in 1821, at a dinner where
were also Adele Dupois, Frederic Dupetit-Mere and Mlle. Millot,
Braulard's mistress. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

DUDLEY (Lord), statesman; one of the most distinguished of the older
English peers living in Paris after 1816; husband of Lady Arabella
Dudley; natural father of Henri de Marsay, to whom he paid small
attention, and who became the lover of Arabella. He was "profoundly
immoral." He reckoned among his illegitimate progeny, Euphemia
Porraberil, and among the women he maintained a certain Hortense who
lived on rue Tronchet. Before removing to France, Lord Dudley lived in
his native land with two sons born in wedlock, but who were
astonishingly like Marsay. [The Lily of the Valley. The Thirteen. A
Man of Business.] Lord Dudley was present at Mlle. des Touches,
shortly after 1830, when Marsay, then prime minister, told of his
first love affair, these two statesmen exchanged philosophical
reflections. [Another Study of Woman.] In 1834 he chanced to be
present at a grand ball given by his wife, when he gambled in a salon
with bankers, ambassadors and retired ministers. [A Daughter of Eve.]

DUDLEY (Lady Arabella), wife of the preceding; member of an
illustrious English family that was free of any /mesalliance/ from the
time of the Conquest; exceedingly wealthy; one of those almost regal
ladies; the idol of the highest French society during the Restoration.
She did not live with her husband to whom she had left two sons who
resembled Marsay, whose mistress she had been. In some way she
succeeded in taking Felix de Vandenesse away from Mme. de Mortsauf,
thus causing that virtuous woman keen anguish. She was born, so she
said, in Lancashire, where women die of love. [The Lily of the
Valley.] In the early years of the reign of Charles X., at least
during the summers, she lived at the village of Chatenay, near Sceaux.
[The Ball at Sceaux.] Raphael de Valentin desired her and would have
sought her but for the fear of exhausting the "magic skin." [The Magic
Skin.] In 1832 she was among the guests at a soiree given by Mme.
d'Espard, where the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse was maligned in the
presence of Daniel d'Arthez, in love with her. [The Secrets of a
Princess.] She was quite jealous of Mme. Felix de Vandenesse, the wife
of her old-time lover, and in 1834-35 she manoeuvred, with Mme. de
Listomere and Mme. d'Espard to make the young woman fall into the arms
of the poet Nathan, whom she wished to be even homelier than he was.
She said to Mme. Felix de Vandenesse: "Marriage, my child, is our
purgatory; love our paradise." [A Daughter of Eve.] Lady Dudley,
vengeance-bent, caused Lady Brandon to die of grief. [Letters of Two
Brides.]

DUFAU, justice of the peace in a commune in the outskirts of Grenoble,
where Dr. Benassis was mayor under the Restoration. Then a tall, bony
man with gray locks and clothed in black. He aided materially in the
work of regeneration accomplished by the physician in the village.
[The Country Doctor.]

DUFAURE (Jules-Armand-Stanislaus), attorney and French politician;
born December 4, 1798, at Saujon, Charente-Inferieure; died an
Academician at Rueil in the summer of 1881; friend and co-disciple of
Louis Lambert and of Barchou de Penhoen at the college of Vendome in
1811. [Louis Lambert.]

DUMAY (Anne-Francois-Bernard), born at Vannes in 1777; son of a rather
mean lawyer, the president of a revolutionary tribunal under the
Republic, and a victim of the guillotine subsequent to the ninth
Thermidor. His mother died of grief. In 1799 Anne Dumay enlisted in
the army of Italy. On the overthrow of the Empire, he retired with the
rank of Lieutenant, and came in touch with Charles Mignon, with whom
he had become acquainted early in his military career. He was
thoroughly devoted to his friend, who had once saved his life at
Waterloo. He gave great assistance to the commercial enterprises of
the Mignon house, and faithfully looked after the interests of Mme.
and Mlle. Mignon during the protracted absence of the head of the
family, who was suddenly ruined. Mignon came back from America a rich
man, and he made Dumay share largely in his fortune. [Modeste Mignon.]

DUMAY (Madame), nee Grummer, wife of the foregoing; a pretty little
American woman who married Dumay while he was on a journey to America
on behalf of his patron and friend Charles Mignon, during the
Restoration. Having had the misfortune to lose several children at
birth, and deprived of the hope of others, she became entirely devoted
to the two Mignon girls. She as well as her husband was thoroughly
attached to that family. [Modeste Mignon.]

DUPETIT-MERE (Frederic), born at Paris in 1785 and died in 1827;
dramatic author who enjoyed his brief hour of fame. Under the name of
Frederic he constructed either singly, or in collaboration with
Ducange, Rougemont, Brazier and others, a large number of melodramas,
vaudevilles, and fantasies. In 1821 he was present with Ducange, Adele
Dupuis and Mlle. Millot at a dinner at Braulard's, the head-claquer.
[A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

DUPLANTY (Abbe), vicar of Saint-Francois church at Paris; at
Schmucke's request he administered extreme unction to the dying Pons,
in April, 1845, who understood and appreciated his goodness. [Cousin
Pons.]

DUPLAY (Madame), wife of a carpenter of rue Honore at whose house
Robespierre lived; a customer of the grocer Descoings, whom she
denounced as a forestaller. This accusation led to the grocer's
imprisonment and execution. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

DUPOTET, a sort of banker established at Croisic under the
Restoration. He had on deposit the modest patrimony of Pierre
Cambremer. [A Seaside Tragedy.]

DUPUIS, notary of the Saint-Jacques quarter, time of Louis Philippe;
affectedly pious; beadle of the parish. He kept the savings of a lot
of servants. Theodose de la Peyrade, who drummed up trade for him in
this special line, induced Mme. Lambert, the housekeeper of M. Picot,
to place two thousand five hundred francs, saved at her employer's
expense, with this virtuous man, who immediately went into bankruptcy.
[The Middle Classes.]

DUPUIS (Adele), Parisian actress who for a long time and brilliantly
held the leading roles and creations at the Gaite theatre. In 1821 she
dined with the chief claquer, Braulard, in company with Ducange,
Frederic Dupetit-Mere and Mlle. Millot. [A Distinguished Provincial at
Paris.]

DURAND, real name of the Chessels. This name of Chessel had been
borrowed by Mme. Durand, who was born a Chessel.

DURET (Abbe), cure of Sancerre during the Restoration; aged member of
the old clerical school. Excellent company; a frequenter of the home
of Mme. de la Baudraye, where he satisfied his penchant for gaming.
With much /finesse/ Duret showed this young woman the character of M.
de la Baudraye in its true light. He counseled her to seek in
literature relief from the bitterness of her wedded life. [The Muse of
the Department.]

DURIAU, a celebrated accoucheur of Paris. Assisted by Bianchon he
delivered Mme. de la Baudraye of a child at the home of Lousteau, its
father, in 1837. [The Muse of the Department.]

DURIEU, cook and house servant at the chateau de Cinq-Cygne, under the
Consulate. An old and trusted servant, thoroughly devoted to his
mistress, Laurence de Cinq-Cygne, whose fortunes he had always
followed. He was a married man, his wife being general housekeeper in
the establishment. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

DUROC (Gerard-Christophe-Michel), Duc de Frioul; grand marshal of the
palace of Napoleon; born at Pont-a-Mousson, in 1772; killed on the
battlefield in 1813. On October 13, 1806, the eve of the battle of
Jena, he conducted the Marquis de Chargeboeuf and Laurence de Cinq-
Cygne to the Emperor's presence. [The Gondreville Mystery.] In April,
1813, he was at a dress-parade at the Carrousel, Paris, when Napoleon
addressed him, regarding Mlle. de Chatillonest, noted by him in the
throng, in language which made the grand marshal smile. [A Woman of
Thirty.]

DURUT (Jean-Francois), a criminal whom Prudence Servien helped convict
to hard labor by her testimony in the Court of Assizes. Durut took
oath to Prudence, before the same tribunal, that, once free, he would
kill her. However, he was executed at the bagne of Toulon four years
later (1829). Jacques Collin, alias Vautrin, to obtain Prudence's
affections, boasted of having freed her from Durut, whose threat held
her in perpetual terror. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

DUTHEIL (Abbe), one of the two vicars-general of the Bishop of Limoges
during the Restoration. One of the lights of the Gallican clergy. Made
a bishop in August, 1831, and promoted to archbishop in 1840. He
presided at the public confession of Mme. Graslin, whose friend and
advisor he was, and whose funeral procession he followed in 1844. [The
Country Parson.]

DUTOCQ, born in 1786. In 1814 he entered the Department of Finance,
succeeding Poiret senior who was displaced in the bureau directed by
Rabourdin. He was order clerk. Idle and incapable, he hated his chief
and caused his overthrow. Very despicable and very prying, he tried to
make his place secure by acting as spy in the bureau. Chardin des
Lupeaulx, the secretary-general, was advised by him of the slightest
developments. After 1816, Dutocq outwardly affected very pronounced
religious tendencies because he believed them useful to his
advancement. He eagerly collected old engravings, possessing complete
"his Charlet," which he desired to give or lend to the minister's
wife. At this time he dwelt on rue Saint-Louis-Saint-Honore (in 1854
this street disappeared) near Palais Royal, on the fifth floor of an
enclosed house, and boarded in a pension of rue de Beaune. [The
Government Clerks.] In 1840, retired, he clerked for a justice of the
peace of the Pantheon municipality, and lived in Thuillier's house,
rue Saint-Dominique d'Enfer. He was a bachelor and had all the vices
which, however, he religiously concealed. He kept in with his
superiors by fawning. He was concerned with the villainous intrigues
of Cerizet, his copy-clerk, and with Theodose de la Peyrade, the
tricky lawyer. [The Middle Classes.]

DUVAL, wealthy forge-master of Alencon, whose daughter the grand-
niece of M. du Croisier (du Bousquier), was married in 1830 to
Victurnien d'Esgrignon. Her dowry was three million francs.
[Jealousies of a Country Town.]

DUVAL, famous professor of chemistry at Paris in 1843. A friend of Dr.
Bianchon, at whose instance he analyzed the blood of M. and Mme.
Crevel, who were infected by a peculiar cutaneous disease of which
they died. [Cousin Betty.]

DUVIGNON. (See Lanty, de.)

DUVIVIER, jeweler at Vendome during the Empire. Mme. de Merret
declared to her husband that she had purchased of this merchant an
ebony crucifix encrusted with silver; but in truth she had obtained it
of her lover, Bagos de Feredia. She swore falsely on this very
crucifix. [La Grande Breteche.]



E

EMILE, a "lion of the most triumphant kind," of the acquaintance of
Mme. Komorn--Countess Godollo. One evening in 1840 or 1841 this woman,
in order to avoid Theodose de la Peyrade, on the Boulevard des
Italiens, took the dandy's arm and requested him to take her to
Mabille. [The Middle Classes.]

ESGRIGNON (Charles-Marie-Victor-Ange-Carol, Marquis d'), or, Des
Grignons--following the earlier name--commander of the Order of Saint-
Louis; born about 1750, died in 1830. Head of a very ancient family of
the Francs, the Karawls who came from the North to conquer the Gauls,
and who were entrusted with the defence of a French highway. The
Esgrignons, quasi-princes under the house of Valois and all-powerful
under Henry IV., were very little known at the court of Louis XVIII.;
and the marquis, ruined by the Revolution, lived in rather reduced
circumstances at Alencon in an old gable-roofed house formerly
belonging to him, which had been sold as common property, and which
the faithful notary Chesnel had repurchased, together with certain
portions of his other estates. The Marquis d'Esgrignon, though not
having to emigrate, was still obliged to conceal himself. He
participated in the Vendean struggle against the Republic, and was one
of the members of the Committee Royal of Alencon. In 1800, at the age
of fifty, in the hope of perpetuating his race, he married Mlle. de
Nouastre, who died in child-birth, leaving the marquis an only son. M.
d'Esgrignon always overlooked the escapades of this child, whose
reputation was preserved by Chesnel; and he passed away shortly after
the downfall of Charles X., saying: "The Gauls triumph." [The Chouans.
Jealousies of a Country Town.]

ESGRIGNON (Madame d') nee Nouastre; of blood the purest and noblest;
married at twenty-two, in 1800, to Marquis Carol d'Esgrignon, a man of
fifty. She soon died at the birth of an only son. She was "the
prettiest of human beings; in her person were reawakened the charms--
now fanciful--of the feminine figures of the sixteenth century."
[Jealousies of a Country Town.]

ESGRIGNON (Victurnien, Comte, then Marquis d'), only son of Marquis
Carol d'Esgrignon; born about 1800 at Alencon. Handsome and
intelligent, reared with extreme indulgence and kindness by his aunt,
Mlle. Armande d'Esgrignon, he gave himself over without restraint to
all the whims usual to the ingenuous egoism of his age. From eighteen
to twenty-one he squandered eighty thousand francs without the
knowledge of his father and his aunt; the devoted Chesnel footed all
the bills. The youthful d'Esgrignon was systematically urged to wrong-
doing by an ally of his own age, Fabien du Ronceret, a perfidious
fellow of the town whom M. du Croisier employed. About 1823 Victurnien
d'Esgrignon was sent to Paris. There he had the misfortune to fall
into the society of the Parisian /roues/--Marsay, Ronquerolles,
Trailles, Chardin des Lupeaulx, Vandenesse, Ajuda-Pinto, Beaudenord,
Martial de la Roche-Hugon, Manerville, people met at the homes of
Marquise d'Espard, the Duchesses de Grandlieu, de Carigliano, de
Chaulieu, the Marquises d'Aiglemont and de Listomere, Mme. Firmiani
and the Comtesse de Serizy; at the opera and at the embassies--being
welcomed on account of his good name and seeming fortune. It was not
long until he became the lover of the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, ruined
himself for her and ended by forging a note against M. du Croisier for
one hundred thousand francs. His aunt took him back quickly to
Alencon, and by a great effort he was rescued from legal proceedings.
Following this he fought a duel with M. du Croisier, who wounded him
dangerously. Nevertheless, shortly after the death of his father,
Victurnien d'Esgrignon married Mlle. Duval, niece of the retired
contractor. He did not give himself over to his wife, but instead
betook himself to his former gay life of a bachelor. [Jealousies of a
Country Town. Letters of Two Brides.] According to Marguerite Turquet
"the little D'Esgrignon was well soaked" by Antonia. [A Man of
Business.] In 1832 Victurnien d'Esgrignon declared before a numerous
company at Mme. d'Espard's that the Princesse de Cadignan--Mme. de
Maufrigneuse--was a dangerous woman. "To her I owe the disgrace of my
marriage," he added. Daniel d'Arthez, who was then in love with this
woman, was present at the conversation. [The Secrets of a Princess.]
In 1838 Victurnien d'Esgrignon was present with some artists, lorettes
and men about town, at the opening of the house on rue de la Ville-
Eveque given to Josepha Mirah, by the Duc d'Herouville. The young
marquis himself had been Josepha's lover; Baron Hulot and he had been
rivals for her on another occasion. [Cousin Betty.]

ESGRIGNON (Marie-Armande-Claire d'), born about 1775; sister of
Marquis Carol d'Esgrignon and aunt of Victurnien d'Esgrignon to whom
she had been as a mother, with an absolute tenderness. In his old age
her father had married for a second time, and to the young daughter of
a tax collector, ennobled by Louis XIV. She was born of this union
which was looked upon as a horrible /mesalliance/, and although the
marquis loved her dearly he regarded her as an alien. He made her weep
for joy, one day, by saying solemnly: "You are an Esgrignon, my
sister." Emile Blondet, reared at Alencon, had known and loved her in
his childhood, and often later he praised her beauty and good
qualities. On account of her devotion to her nephew she refused M. de
la Roche-Guyon and the Chevalier de Valois, also M. du Bousquier. She
gave the fullest proof of her genuinely maternal affection for
Victurnien, when the latter committed the crime at Paris, which would
have placed him on the prisoner's bench of the Court of Assizes, but
for the clever work of Chesnel. She outlived her brother, given over
"to her religion and her over-thrown beliefs." About the middle of
Louis Philippe's reign Blondet, who had come to Alencon to obtain his
marriage license, was again moved on the contemplation of that noble
face. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

ESPARD (Charles-Maurice-Marie-Andoche, Comte de Negrepelisse, Marquis
d'), born about 1789; by name a Negrepelisse, of an old Southern
family which acquired by a marriage, time of Henry IV., the lands and
titles of the family of Espard, of Bearn, which was allied also with
the Albret house. The device of the d'Espards was: "Des partem
leonis." The Negrepelisses were militant Catholics, ruined at the time
of the Church wars, and afterwards considerably enriched by the
despoiling of a family of Protestant merchants, the Jeanrenauds whose
head had been hanged after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. This
property, so badly acquired, became wondrously profitable to the
Negrepelisses-d'Espards. Thanks to his fortune, the grandfather of the
marquis was enabled to wed a Navarreins-Lansac, an extremely wealthy
heiress; her father was of the younger branch of the Grandlieus. In
1812 the Marquis d'Espard married Mlle. de Blamont-Chauvry, then
sixteen years of age. He had two sons by her, but discord soon arose
between the couple. Her silly extravagances forced the marquis to
borrow. He left her in 1816, going with his two children to live on
rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Genevieve. Here he devoted himself to the
education of his boys and to the composition of a great work; "The
Picturesque History of China," the profits of which, combined with the
savings resultant from an austere manner of living, allowed him to pay
in twelve years' time to the legatees of the suppliant Jeanrenauds
eleven hundred thousand francs, representing the value--time of Louis
XIV.--of the property confiscated from their ancestors. This book was
written, so to speak, in collaboration with Abbe Crozier, and its
financial results aided greatly in comforting the declining years of a
ruined friend, M. de Nouvion. In 1828 Mme. d'Espard tried to have a
guardian appointed for her husband by ridiculing the noble conduct of
the marquis. But the defendant won his rights at court. [The
Commission in Lunacy.] Lucien de Rubempre, who entertained Attorney-
General Granville with an account of this suit, probably was
instrumental in causing the judgment to favor M. d'Espard. Thus he
drew upon himself the hatred of the marquise. [Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.]

ESPARD (Camille, Vicomte d'), second son of Marquis d'Espard; born in
1815; pursued his studies at the college of Henri IV., in company with
his elder brother, the Comte Clement de Negrepelisse. He studied
rhetoric in 1828. [The Commission in Lunacy.]

ESPARD (Chevalier d'), brother of Marquis d'Espard, whom he wished to
see interdicted, in order that he might be made curator. His face was
thin as a knife-blade, and he was frigid and severe. Judge Popinot
said he reminded him somewhat of Cain. He was one of the deepest
personages to be found in the Marquise d'Espard's drawing-room, and
was the political half of that woman. [The Commission in Lunacy.
Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. The Secrets of a Princess.]

ESPARD (Jeanne-Clementine-Athenais de Blamont-Chauvry, Marquise d'),
born in 1795; wife of Marquis d'Espard; of one of the most illustrious
houses of Faubourg Saint-Germain. Deserted by her husband in 1816, she
was at the age of twenty-two mistress of herself and of her fortune,
an income of twenty-six thousand francs. At first she lived in
seclusion; then in 1820 she appeared at court, gave some receptions at
her own home, and did not long delay about becoming a society woman.
Cold, vain and coquettish she knew neither love nor hatred; her
indifference for all that did not directly concern her was profound.
She never showed emotion. She had certain scientific formulas for
preserving her beauty. She never wrote but spoke instead, believing
that two words from a woman were sufficient to kill three men. More
than once she made epigrams to peers or deputies which the courts of
Europe treasured. In 1828 she still passed with the men for youthful.
Mme. d'Espard lived at number 104 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore. [The
Commission in Lunacy.] She was a magnificent Celimene. She displayed
such prudence and severity on her separation from her husband that
society was at a loss to account for this disagreement. She was
surrounded by her relatives, the Navarreins, the Blamont-Chauvrys and
the Lenoncourts; ladies of the highest social position claimed her
acquaintance. She was a cousin of Mme. de Bargeton, who was
rehabilitated by her on her arrival from Angouleme in 1821, and whom
she introduced into Paris, showing her all the secrets of elegant life
and taking her away from Lucien de Rubempre. Later, when the
"Distinguished Provincial" had won his way into high society, she, at
the instance of Mme. de Montcornet, enlisted him on the Royalist side.
[A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] In 1824 she was at an Opera
ball to which she had come through an anonymous note, and, leaning on
the arm of Sixte du Chatelet, she met Lucien de Rubempre whose beauty
struck her and whom she seemed, indeed, not to remember. The poet had
his revenge for her former disdain, by means of some cutting phrases,
and Jacques Collin--Vautrin--masked, caused her uneasiness by
persuading her that Lucien was the author of the note and that he
loved her. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] The Chaulieus were
intimate with her at the time when their daughter Louise was courted
by Baron de Macumer. [Letters of Two Brides.] Despite the silent
opposition of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, after the Revolution of
1830, the Marquise d'Espard did not close her salon, since she did not
wish to renounce her Parisian prestige. In this she was seconded by
one or two women in her circle and by Mlle. des Touches. [Another
Study of Woman.] She was at home Wednesdays. In 1833 she attended a
soiree at the home of the Princesse de Cadignan, where Marsay
disclosed the mystery surrounding the abduction of Senator Malin in
1806. [The Gondreville Mystery.] Notwithstanding an evil report
circulated against her by Mme. d'Espard, the princesse told Daniel
d'Arthez that the marquise was her best friend; she was related to
her. [The Secrets of a Princess.] Actuated by jealousy for Mme. Felix
de Vandenesse, Mme. d'Espard fostered the growing intimacy between the
young woman and Nathan the poet; she wished to see an apparent rival
compromised. In 1835 the marquise defended vaudeville entertainments
against Lady Dudley, who said she could not endure them. [A Daughter
of Eve.] In 1840, on leaving the Italiens, Mme. d'Espard humiliated
Mme. de Rochefide by snubbing her; all the women followed her example,
shunning the mistress of Calyste du Guenic. [Beatrix.] In short the
Marquise d'Espard was one of the most snobbish people of her day. Her
disposition was sour and malevolent, despite its elegant veneer.

ESTIVAL (Abbe d'), provincial priest and Lenten exhorter at the church
of Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas, Paris. According to Theodose de la
Peyrade, who pointed him out to Mlle. Colleville, he was devoted to
predication in the interest of the poor. By spirituality and unction
he redeemed a scarcely agreeable exterior. [The Middle Classes.]

ESTORADE (Baron, afterwards Comte de l'), a little Provincial
gentleman, father of Louis de l'Estorade. A very religious and very
miserly man who hoarded for his son. He lost his wife about 1814, who
died of grief through lack of hope of ever seeing her son again--
having heard nothing of him after the battle of Leipsic. M. de
l'Estorade was an excellent grandparent. He died at the end of 1826.
[Letters of Two Brides.]

ESTORADE (Louis, Chevalier, then Vicomte and Comte de l') son of the
preceding; peer of France; president of the Chamber in the Court of
Accounts; grand officer of the Legion of Honor; born in 1787. After
having been excluded from the conscription under the Empire, for a
long time, he was enlisted in 1813, serving on the Guard of Honor. At
Leipsic he was captured by the Russians and did not reappear in France
until the Restoration. He suffered severely in Siberia; at thirty-
seven he appeared to be fifty. Pale, lean, taciturn and somewhat deaf,
he bore much resemblance to the Knight of the Rueful Countenance. He
succeeded, however, in making himself agreeable to Renee de Maucombe
whom he married, dowerless, in 1824. Urged on by his wife who became
ambitious after becoming a mother, he left Crampade, his country
estate, and although a mediocre he rose to the highest offices.
[Letters of Two Brides. The Member for Arcis.]

ESTORADE (Madame de l'), born Renee de Maucombe in 1807, of a very old
Provencal family, located in the Gemenos Valley, twenty kilometres
from Marseilles. She was educated at the Carmelite convent of Blois,
where she was intimate with Louise de Chaulieu. The two friends always
remained constant. For several years they corresponded, writing about
life, love and marriage, when Renee the wise gave to the passionate
Louise advice and prudent counsel not always followed. In 1836 Mme. de
l'Estorade hastened to the country to be present at the death-bed of
her friend, now become Mme. Marie Gaston. Renee de Maucombe was
married at the age of seventeen, upon leaving the convent. She gave
her husband three children, though she never loved him, devoting
herself to the duties of motherhood. [Letters of Two Brides.] In
1838-39 the serenity of this sage person was disturbed by meeting
Dorlange-Sallenauve. She believed he sought her, and she must needs
fight an insidious liking for him. Mme. de Camps counseled and
enlightened Mme. de l'Estorade, with considerable foresight, in this
delicate crisis. Some time later, when a widow, Mme. de l'Estorade was
on the point of giving her hand to Sallenauve, who became her son-in-
law. [The Member for Arcis.] In 1841 Mme. de l'Estorade remarked of M.
and Mme. Savinien de Portenduere: "Theirs is the most perfect
happiness that I have ever seen!" [Ursule Mirouet.]

ESTORADE (Armand de l'), elder son of M. and Mme. de l'Estorade;
godson of Louise de Chaulieu, who was Baronne de Macumer and
afterwards Mme. Marie Gaston. Born in December, 1825; educated at the
college of Henri IV. At first stupid and meditative, he awakened
afterwards, was crowned at Sorbonnne, having obtained first prize for
a translation of Latin, and in 1845 made a brilliant showing in his
thesis for the degree of doctor of laws. [Letters of Two Brides. The
Member for Arcis.]

ESTORADE (Rene de l'), second child of M. and Mme. de l'Estorade. Bold
and adventurous as a child. He had a will of iron, and his mother was
convinced that he would be "the cunningest sailor afloat." [Letters of
Two Brides.]

ESTORADE (Jeanne-Athenais de l'), daughter and third child of M. and
Mme. de l'Estorade. Called "Nais" for short. Married in 1847 to
Charles de Sallenauve. (See Sallenauve, Mme. Charles de.)

ESTOURNY (Charles d'), a young dandy of Paris who went to Havre during
the Restoration to view the sea, obtained entrance into the Mignon
household and eloped with Bettina-Caroline, the elder daughter. He
afterwards deserted her and she died of shame. In 1827 Charles
d'Estourny was sentenced by the police court for habitual fraud in
gambling. [Modeste Mignon.] A Georges-Marie Destourny, who styled
himself Georges d'Estourny, was the son of a bailiff, at Boulogne,
near Paris, and was undoubtedly identical with Charles d'Estourny. For
a time he was the protector of Esther van Gobseck, known as La
Torpille. He was born about 1801, and, after having obtained a
splendid education, had been left without resources by his father, who
was forced to sell out under adverse circumstances. Georges d'Estourny
speculated on the Bourse with money obtained from "kept" women who
trusted in him. After his sentence he left Paris without squaring his
accounts. He had aided Cerizet, who afterwards became his partner. He
was a handsome fellow, open-hearted and generous as the chief of
robbers. On account of the knaveries which brough him into court,
Bixiou nicknamed him "Tricks at Cards." [Scenes from a Courtesan's
Life. A Man of Business.]

ETIENNE & CO., traders at Paris under the Empire. In touch with
Guillaume, clothier of rue Saint-Denis, who foresaw their failure and
awaited "with anxiety as at a game of cards." [At the Sign of the Cat
and Racket.]

EUGENE, Corsican colonel of the Sixth regiment of the line, which was
made up almost entirely of Italians--the first to enter Tarragone in
1808. Colonel Eugene, a second Murat, was extraordinarily brave. He
knew how to make use of the species of bandits who composed his
regiment. [The Maranas.]

EUGENIE, assumed name of Prudence Servien, which name see.

EUPHRASIE, Parisian courtesan, time of the Restoration and Louis
Philippe. A pretty, winsome blonde with blue eyes and a melodious
voice; she had an air of the utmost frankness, yet was profoundly
depraved and expert in refined vice. In 1821 she transmitted a
terrible and fatal disease to Crottat, the notary. At that time she
lived on rue Feydeau. Euphrasie pretended that in her early youth she
had passed entire days and nights trying to support a lover who had
forsaken her for a heritage. With the brunette, Aquilina, Euphrasie
took part in a famous orgy, at the home of Frederic Taillefer, on rue
Joubert, where were also Emile Blondet, Rastignac, Bixiou and Raphael
de Valentin. Later she is seen at the Theatre-Italien, in company with
the aged antiquarian, who had sold Raphael the celebrated "magic
skin"; she was running through with the old merchant's treasures.
[Melmoth Reconciled. The Magic Skin.]

EUROPE, assumed name of Prudence Servien, which name see.

EVANGELISTA (Madame), born Casa-Real in 1781, of a great Spanish
family collaterally descended from the Duke of Alva and related to the
Claes of Douai; a creole who came to Bordeaux in 1800 with her
husband, a large Spanish financier. In 1813 she was left a widow, with
her daughter. She paid no thought to the value of money, never knowing
how to resist a whim. So one morning in 1821 she was forced to call on
the broker and expert, Elie Magus, to get an estimate on the value of
her magnificent diamonds. She became wearied of life in the country,
and therefore favored the marriage of her daughter with Paul de
Manerville, in order that she might follow the young couple to Paris
where she dreamed of appearing in grand style and of a further
exercise of her power. For that matter she displayed much astuteness
in arranging the details of this marriage, at which time Maitre
Solonet, her notary, was much taken with her, desiring to wed her, and
defending her warmly against Maitre Mathias the lawyer for the
Manervilles. Beneath the exterior of an excellent woman she knew, like
Catherine de Medicis, how to hate and wait. [A Marriage Settlement.]

EVANGELISTA (Natalie), daughter of Mme. Evangelista; married to Paul
de Manerville. (See that name.)

EVELINA, young girl of noble blood, wealthy and cultured, of a strict
Jansenist family; sought in marriage by Benassis, in the beginning of
the Restoration. Evelina reciprocated Benassis' love, but her parents
opposed the match. Evelina died soon after gaining her freedom and the
doctor did not survive her long. [The Country Doctor.]



F

FAILLE & BOUCHOT, Parisian perfumers who failed in 1818. They gave an
order for ten thousand phials of peculiar shape to hold a new
cosmetic, which phials Anselme Popinot purchased for four sous each on
six months' time, with the intention of filling them with the
"Cephalic Oil" invented by Cesar Birotteau. [Cesar Birotteau.]

FALCON (Jean), alias Beaupied, or more often Beau-Pied, sergeant in
the Seventy-second demi-brigade in 1799, under the command of Colonel
Hulot. Jean Falcon was the clown of his company. Formerly he had
served in the artillery. [The Chouans.] In 1808, still under the
command of Hulot, he was one in the army of Spain and in the troops
led by Murat. In that year he was witness of the death of Bega, the
French surgeon, assassinated by a Spaniard. [The Muse of the
Department.] In 1841 he was body-servant of his old-time colonel, now
become a marshal. For thirty years he had been in his employ. [Cousin
Betty.]

FALCON (Marie-Cornelie), famous singer of the Opera; born at Paris on
January 28, 1812. On July 20, 1832, she made a brilliant debut in the
role of Alice, in "Robert le Diable." She also created with equal
success the parts of Rachel in "La Juive" and Valentine in "The
Huguenots." In 1836 the composer Conti declared to Calyste du Guenic
that he was madly enamored of this singer, "the youngest and prettiest
of her time." He even wished to marry her--so he said--but this remark
was probably a thrust at Calyste, who was smitten with the Marquise de
Rochefide, whose lover the musician was at this time. [Beatrix.]
Cornelie Falcon disappears from the scene in 1840, after a famous
evening when, before a sympathetic audience, she mourned on account of
the ruin of her voice. She married a financier, M. Malencon, and is
now a grandmother. Mme. Falcon has given, in the provinces, her name
to designate tragic "sopranos." "La Vierge de l'Opera," interestingly
delineated by M. Emmanuel Gonzales, reveals--according to him--certain
incidents in her career.

FALLEIX (Martin), Auvergnat coppersmith on rue du Faubourg Saint-
Antoine, Paris; born about 1796; he had come from the country with his
kettle under his arm. He was patronized by Bidault, alias Gigonnet,
who advanced him capital though at heavy interest. The usurer also
introduced him to Saillard, the cashier of the Minister of Finance,
who with his savings enabled him to open a foundry. Martin Falleix
obtained a brevet for invention and a gold medal at the Exposition of
1824. Mme. Baudoyer undertook his education, deciding he would do for
a son-in-law. On his side he worked for the interests of his future
father-in-law. [The Government Clerks.] About 1826 he discussed on the
Bourse, with Du Tillet, Werbrust and Claparon, the third liquidation
of Nucingen, which solidly established the fortune of that celebrated
Alsatian banker. [The Firm of Nucingen.]

FALLEIX (Jacques), brother of the preceding; stock-broker, one of the
shrewdest and richest, the successor of Jules Desmarets and stock-
broker for the firm of Nucingen. On rue Saint-George he fitted up a
most elegant little house for his mistress, Mme. du Val-Noble. He
failed in 1829, the victim of one of the Nucingen liquidations. [The
Government Clerks. The Thirteen. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

FANCHETTE, servant of Doctor Rouget at Issoudun, at the close of the
eighteenth century; a stout Berrichonne who, before the advent of La
Cognette, was thought to be the best cook in town. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

FANJAT, physician and something of an alienist; uncle of Comtesse
Stephanie de Vandieres. She was supposed to have perished in the
disaster of the Russian campaign. He found her near Strasbourg, in
1816, a lunatic, and took her to the ancient convent of Bon-Hommes,
in the outskirts of l'Isle Adam, Seine-et-Oise, where he tended her
with a tender care. In 1819 he had the sorrow of seeing her expire as
a result of a tragic scene when, recovering her reason all at once,
she recognized her former lover Philippe de Sucy, whom she had not
seen since 1812. [Farewell.]

FANNY, aged servant in the employ of Lady Brandon, at La Grenadiere
under the Restoration. She closed the eyes of her mistress, whom she
adored, then conducted the two children from that house to one of a
cousin of hers, an old retired dressmaker of Tours, rue de la Guerche
(now rue Marceau), where she intended to live with them; but the elder
of the sons of Lady Brandon enlisted in the navy and placed his
brother in college, under the guidance of Fanny. [La Grenadiere.]

FANNY, young girl of romantic temperament, fair and blonde, the only
daughter of a banker of Paris. One evening at her father's house she
asked the Bavarian Hermann for a "dreadful German story," and thus
innocently led to the death of Frederic Taillefer who had in his youth
committed a secret murder, now related in his hearing. [The Red Inn.]

FARIO, old Spanish prisoner of war at Issoudun during the Empire.
After peace was declared he remained there making a small business
venture in grains. He was of Grenada and had been a peasant. He was
the butt of many scurvy tricks on the part of the "Knights of
Idlesse," and he avenged himself by stabbing their leader, Maxence
Gilet. This attempted assassination was momentarily charged to Joseph
Bridau. Fario finally obtained full satisfaction for his vindictive
spirit by witnessing a duel where Gilet fell mortally wounded by the
hand of Philippe Bridau. Gilet had previously become disconcerted by
the presence of the grain-dealer on the field of battle. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

FARRABESCHE, ex-convict, now an estate-guard for Mme. Graslin, at
Montegnac, time of Louis Philippe; of an old family of La Correze;
born about 1791. He had had an elder brother killed at Montebello, in
1800 a captain at twenty-two, who by his surpassing heroism had saved
the army and the Consul Bonaparte. There was, too, a second brother
who fell at Austerlitz in 1805, a sergeant in the First regiment of
the Guard. Farrabesche himself had got it into his head that he would
never serve, and when summoned in 1811 he fled to the woods. There he
affiliated more or less with the Chauffeurs and, accused of several
assassinations, was sentenced to death for contumacy. At the instance
of Abbe Bonnet he gave himself up, at the beginnng of the Restoration,
and was sent to the bagne for ten years, returning in 1827. After
1830, re-established as a citizen, he married Catherine Curieux, by
whom he had a child. Abbe Bonnet for one, and Mme. Graslin for
another, proved themselves counselors and benefactors of Farrabesche.
[The Country Parson.]

FARRABESCHE (Madame), born Catherine Curieux, about 1798; daughter of
the tenants of Mme. Brezac, at Vizay, an important mart of La Correze;
mistress of Farrabesche in the last years of the Empire. She bore him
a son, at the age of seventeen, and was soon separated from her lover
on his imprisonment in the galleys. She returned to Paris and hired
out. In her last place she worked for an old lady whom she tended
devotedly, but who died leaving her nothing. In 1833 she came back to
the country; she was just out of a hospital, cured of a disease caused
by fatigue, but still very feeble. Shortly after she married her
former lover. Catherine Curieux was rather large, well-made, pale,
gentle and refined by her visit to Paris, though she could neither
read nor write. She had three married sisters, one at Aubusson, one at
Limoges, and one at Saint-Leonard. [The Country Parson.]

FARRABESCHE (Benjamin), son of Farrabesche and Catherine Curieux; born
in 1815; brought up by the relatives of his mother until 1827, then
taken back by his father whom he dearly loved and whose energetic and
rough nature he inherited. [The Country Parson.]

FAUCOMBE (Madame de), sister of Mme. de Touches and aunt of Felicite
des Touches--Camille Maupin;--an inmate of the convent of Chelles, to
whom Felicite was confided by her dying mother, in 1793. The nun took
her niece to Faucombe, a considerable estate near Nantes belonging to
the deceased mother, where she (the nun) died of fear in 1794.
[Beatrix.]

FAUCOMBE (De), grand-uncle on the maternal side of Felicite des
Touches. Born about 1734, died in 1814. He lived at Nantes, and in his
old age had married a frivolous young woman, to whom he turned over
the conduct of affairs. A passionate archaeologist he gave little
attention to the education of his grand-niece who was left with him in
1794, after the death of Mme. de Faucombe, the aged nun of Chelles.
Thus it happened that Felicite grew up by the side of the old man and
young woman, without guidance, and left entirely to her own devices.
[Beatrix.]

FAUSTINE, a young woman of Argentan who was executed in 1813 at
Mortagne for having killed her child. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

FELICIE, chambermaid of Mme. Diard at Bordeaux in 1823. [The Maranas.]

FELICITE, a stout, ruddy, cross-eyed girl, the servant of Mme.
Vauthier who ran a lodging-house on the corner of Notre-Dame-des-
Champs and Boulevard du Montparnasse, time of Louis Philippe. [The
Seamy Side of History.]

FELIX, office-boy for Attorney-General Granville, in 1830. [Scenes
from a Courtesan's Life.]

FENDANT, former head-clerk of the house of Vidal & Porchon; a partner
with Cavalier. Both were book-sellers, publishers, and book-dealers,
doing business on rue Serpente, Paris, about 1821. At this time they
had dealings with Lucien Chardon de Rubempre. The house for social
reasons was known as Fendant & Cavalier. Half-rascals, they passed for
clever fellows. While Cavalier traveled, Fendant, the more wily of the
two, managed the business. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

FERDINAND, real name of Ferdinand du Tillet.

FERDINAND, fighting name of one of the principal figures in the Breton
uprising of 1799. One of the companions of MM. du Guenic, de la
Billardiere, de Fontaine and de Montauran. [The Chouans. Beatrix.]

FEREDIA (Count Bagos de), Spanish prisoner of war at the Vendome under
the Empire; lover of Mme. de Merret. Surprised one evening by the
unexpected return of her husband, he took refuge in a closet which was
ordered walled up by M. de Merret. There he died heroically without
even uttering a cry. [La Grande Breteche.]

FERET (Athanase), law-clerk of Maitre Bordin, procureur to the
Chatelet in 1787. [A Start in Life.]

FERRAGUS XXIII. (see Bourignard.)

FERRARO (Count), Italian colonel whom Castanier had known during the
Empire, and whose death in the Zembin swamps Castanier alone had
witnessed. The latter therefore intended to assume Ferraro's
personality in Italy after forging certain letters of credit. [Melmoth
Reconciled.]

FERRAUD (Comte), son of a returned councillor of the Parisian
Parliament who had emigrated during the Terror, and who was ruined by
these events. Born in 1781. During the Consulate he returned to
France, at which time he declined certain offers made by Bonaparte. He
remained ever true to the tenets of Louis XVIII. Of pleasing presence
he won his way, and the Faubourg Saint-Germain regarded him as an
ornament. About 1809 he married the widow of Colonel Chabert, who had
an income of forty thousand francs. By her he had two children, a son
and a daughter. He resided on rue de Varenne, having a pretty villa in
the Montmorency Valley. During the Restoration he was made director-
general in a ministry, and councillor of state. [Colonel Chabert.]

FERRAUD (Comtesse), born Rose Chapotel; wife of Comte Ferraud. During
the Republic, or at the commencement of the Empire, she married her
first husband, an officer named Hyacinthe and known as Chabert, who
was left for dead on the battlefield of Eylau, in 1807. About 1818 he
tried to reassert his marital rights. Colonel Chabert claimed to have
taken Rose Chapotel out of a questionable place at Palais-Royal.
During the Restoration this woman was a countess and one of the queens
of Parisian society. When brought face to face with her first husband
she feigned at first not to recognize him, then she displayed such a
dislike for him that he abandoned his idea of legal restitution.
[Colonel Chabert.] The Comtesse Ferraud was the last mistress of Louis
XVIII., and remained in favor at the court of Charles X. She and
Mesdames de Listomere, d'Espard, de Camps and de Nucingen were invited
to the select receptions of the Minister of Finance, in 1824. [The
Government Clerks.]

FERRAUD (Jules), son of Comte Ferraud and Rose Chapotel, the Comtesse
Ferraud. While still a child, in 1817 or 1818, he was one day at his
mother's house when Colonel Chabert called. She wept and he asked
hotly if the officer was responsible for the grief of the countess.
The latter with her two children then played a maternal comedy which
was successful with the ingenuous soldier. [Colonel Chabert.]

FESSARD, grocer at Saumur during the Restoration. Astonished one day
by Nanon's, the servant's, purchase of a wax-candle, he asked if "the
three magi were visiting them." [Eugenie Grandet.]

FICHET (Mademoiselle), the richest heiress of Issoudun during the
Restoration. Godet, junior, one of the "Knights of Idlesse" paid court
to her mother in the hope of obtaining, as a reward for his devotion,
the hand of the young girl. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

FINOT (Andoche), managing-editor of journals and reviews, times of the
Restoration and Louis Philippe. Son of a hatter of rue du Coq (now rue
Marengo). Finot was abandoned by his father, a hard trader, and made a
poor beginning. He wrote a bombastic announcement for Popinot's
"Cephalic Oil." His first work was attending to announcements and
personals in the papers. He was invited to the Birotteau ball. Finot
was acquainted with Felix Gaudissart, who introduced him to little
Anselme, as a great promoter. He was previously on the editorial staff
of the "Courrier des Spectacles," and he had a piece performed at the
Gaite. [Cesar Birotteau.] In 1820 he ran a little theatrical paper
whose office was located on rue du Sentier. He was nephew of
Giroudeau, a captain of dragoons; was witness of the marriage of J.-J.
Rouget. [A Bachelor's Establishment.] in 1821 Finot's paper was on rue
Saint-Fiacre. Etienne Lousteau, Hector Merlin, Felicien Vernou,
Nathan, F. du Bruel and Blondet all contributed to it. Then it was
that Lucien de Rubempre made his reputation by a remarkable report of
"L'Alcade dans l'embarras," a three act drama performed at the
Panorama-Dramatique. Finot then lived on rue Feydeau. [A Distinguished
Provincial at Paris.] In 1824 he was at the Opera ball in a group of
dandies and litterateurs, which surrounded Lucien de Rubempre, who was
flirting with Esther Gobseck. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] In
this year Finot was guest at an entertainment at the home of
Rabourdin, the chief of bureau, when he allowed himself to be won over
to that official's cause by his friend Chardin des Lupeaulx, who had
asked him to exert the voice of the press against Baudoyer, the rival
of Rabourdin. [The Government Clerks.] In 1825 he was present at a
breakfast given at the Rocher de Cancale, by Frederic Marest in
celebration of his entrance to the law office of Desroches; he was
also at the orgy which followed at the home of Florine. [A Start in
Life.] In 1831 Gaudissart said that his friend Finot had an income of
thirty thousand francs, that he would be councillor of state, and was
booked for a peer of France. He aspired to end up as his
"shareholder." [Gaudissart the Great.] In 1836 Finot was dining with
Blondet, his fellow-editor, and with Couture, a man about town, in a
private room of a well-known restaurant, when he heard the story of
the financial trickeries of Nucingen, wittily related by Bixiou. [The
Firm of Nucingen.] Finot concealed "a brutal nature under a mild
exterior," and his "impertinent stupidity was flecked with wit as the
bread of a laborer is flecked with garlic." [Scenes from a Courtesan's
Life.]

FIRMIANI, a respectable quadragenarian who in 1813 married the lady
who afterwards became Mme. Octave de Camps. He was unable, so it was
said, to offer her more than his name and his fortune. He was formerly
receiver-general in the department of Montenotte. He died in Greece in
1823. [Madame Firmiani.]

FIRMIANI (Madame). (See Camps, Mme. de.)

FISCHER, the name of three brothers, laborers in a village situated on
the extreme frontiers of Lorraine, at the foot of the Vosges. They set
out to join the army of the Rhine by reason of Republican
conscriptions. The first, Pierre, father of Lisbeth--or "Cousin Betty"
--was killed in 1815 in the Francstireurs. The second, Andre, father
of Adeline who became the wife of Baron Hulot, died at Treves in 1820.
The third, Johann, having committed some acts of peculation, at the
instigation of his nephew Hulot, while a commissary contractor in
Algiers, province of Oran, committed suicide in 1841. He was over
seventy when he killed himself. [Cousin Betty.]

FISCHER (Adeline). (See Hulot, d'Ervy, Baronne Hector.)

FISCHER (Lisbeth), known as "Cousin Betty"; born in 1796; brought up a
peasant. In her childhood she had to give way to her first cousin, the
pretty Adeline, who was pampered by the whole family. In 1809 she was
called to Paris by Adeline's husband and placed as an apprentice with
the well-known Pons Brothers, embroiderers to the Imperial Court. She
became a skilled workwoman and was about to set up for herself when
the Empire was overthrown. Lisbeth was a Republican, of restive
temperament, capricious, independent and unaccountably savage. She
habitually declined to wed. She refused in succession a clerk of the
minister of war, a major, an army-contractor, a retired captain and a
wealthy lace-maker. Baron Hulot nick-named her the "Nanny-Goat." A
resident of rue du Doyenne (which ended at the Louvre and was
obliterated about 1855), where she worked for Rivet, a successor of
Pons, she made the acquaintance of her neighbor, Wenceslas Steinbock,
a Livonian exile, whom she saved from poverty and suicide, but whom
she watched with a jealous strictness. Hortense Hulot sought out and
succeeded in seeing the Pole; a wedding followed between the young
people which caused Cousin Betty a deep resentment, cunningly
concealed, but terrific in its effects. Through her Wenceslas was
introduced to the irresistible Mme. Marneffe, and the happiness of a
young household was quickly demolished. The same thing happened to
Baron Hulot whose misconduct Lisbeth secretly abetted. Lisbeth died in
1844 of a pulmonary phthisis, principally caused by chagrin at seeing
the Hulot family reunited. The relatives of the old maid never found
out her evil actions. They surrounded her bedside, caring for her and
lamenting the loss of "the angel of the family." Mlle. Fischer died on
rue Louis-le-Grand, Paris, after having dwelt in turn on rues du
Doyenne, Vaneau, Plumet (now Oudinot) and du Montparnasse, where she
managed the household of Marshal Hulot, through whom she dreamed of
wearing the countess' coronet, and for whom she donned mourning.
[Cousin Betty.]

FITZ-WILLIAM (Miss Margaret), daughter of a rich and noble Irishman
who was the maternal uncle of Calyste du Guenic; hence the first
cousin of that young man. Mme. de Guenic, the mother, was desirous of
mating her son with Miss Margaret. [Beatrix.]

FLAMET. (See la Billardiere, Flamet de.)

FLEURANT (Mother), ran a cafe at Croisic which Jacques Cambremer
visited. [A Seaside Tragedy.]

FLEURIOT, grenadier of the Imperial Guard, of colossal size, to whom
Philippe de Sucy entrusted Stephanie de Vandieres, during the passage
of the Beresina in 1812. Unfortunately separated from Stephanie, the
grenadier did not find her again until 1816. She had taken refuge in
an inn of Strasbourg after escaping from an insane asylum. Both were
then sheltered by Dr. Fanjat and taken to Auvergne, where Fleuriot
soon died. [Farewell.]

FLEURY, retired infantry captain, comptroller of the Cirque-
Olympique, and employed during the Restoration in Rabourdin's bureau,
of the minister of finance. He was attached to his chief, who had
saved him from destitution. A subscriber, but a poor payer, to
"Victories and Conquests." A zealous Bonapartist and Liberal. His
three great men were Napoleon, Bolivar and Beranger, all of whose
ballads he knew by heart, and sang in a sweet, sonorous voice. He was
swamped with debt. His skill at fencing and small-arms kept him from
Bixiou's jests. He was likewise much feared by Dutocq who flattered
him basely. Fleury was discharged after the nomination of Baudoyer as
chief of division in December, 1824. He did not take it to heart,
saying that he had at his disposal a managing editorship in a journal.
[The Government Clerks.] In 1840, still working for the above theatre,
Fleury became manager of "L'Echo de la Bievre," the paper owned by
Thuillier. [The Middle Classes.]

FLICOTEAUX, rival of Rousseau the Aquatic. Historic, legendary and
strictly honest restaurant-keeper in the Latin quarter between rue de
la Harpe and rue des Gres--Cujas--enjoying the custom, in 1821-22, of
Daniel d'Arthez, Etienne Lousteau and Lucien Chardon de Rubempre. [A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

FLORENT, partner of Chanor; they were manufacturers and dealers in
bronze, rue des Tournelles, Paris, time of Louis Philippe. [Cousin
Betty. Cousin Pons.]

FLORENTNE. (see Cabirolle, Agathe-Florentine.)

FLORIMOND (Madame), dealer in linens, rue Vielle-du-Temple, Paris,
1844-45. Maintained by an "old fellow" who made her his heir, thanks
to Fraisier, the man of business, whom she perhaps would have married
through gratitude, had it not been for his physical condition. [Cousin
Pons.]

FLORINE. (See Nathan, Mme. Raoul.)

FLORVILLE (La), actress at the Panorama-Dramatique in 1821. Among her
contemporaries were Coralie, Florine, and Bouffe, or Vignol. On the
first night performance of "The Alcade," she played in a curtain-
raiser, "Bertram." For a few days she was the mistress of a Russian
prince who took her to Saint-Mande, paying her manager a good sum for
her absence from the theatre. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

FOEDORA (Comtesse), born about 1805. Of Russian lower class origin and
wonderfully beautiful. Espoused perhaps morganatically by a great lord
of the land. Left a widow she reigned over Paris in 1827. Supposed to
have an income of eighty thousand francs. She received in her drawing-
rooms all the notables of the period, and there "appeared all the
works of fiction that were not published anywhere else." Raphael de
Valentin was presented to the countess by Rastignac and fell
desperately in love with her. But he left her house one day never to
return, being definitely persuaded that she was "a woman without a
heart." Her memory was cruel, and her address enough to drive a
diplomat to despair. Although the Russian ambassador did not receive
her, she had entry into the set of Mme. de Serizy; visited with Mme.
de Nucingen and Mme. de Restaud; received the Duchesse de Carigliano,
the haughtiest of the Bonapartist clique. She had listened to many
young dandies, and to the son of a peer of France, who had offered her
their names in exchange for her fortune. [The Magic Skin.]

FONTAINE (Madame), fortune teller, Paris, rue Vielle-du-Temple, time
of Louis Philippe. At one time a cook. Born in 1767. Earned a
considerable amount of money, but previously had lost heavily in a
lottery. After the suppression of this game of chance she saved up for
the benefit of a nephew. In her divinations Mme. Fontaine made use of
a giant toad named Astaroth, and of a black hen with bristling
feathers, called Cleopatra or Bilouche. These two animals caught
Gazonal's eye in 1845, when in company with De Lora and Bixiou he
visited the fortune-teller's. The Southerner, however, asked only a
five-franc divination, while in the same year Mme. Cibot, who came to
consult her on an important matter, had to pay a hundred francs.
According to Bixiou, "a third of the lorettes, a fourth of the
statesmen and a half of the artists" consulted Mme. Fontaine. She was
the Egeria of a minister, and also looked for "a tidy fortune," which
Bilouche had promised her. [The Unconscious Humorists. Cousin Pons.]

FONTAINE (Comte de), one of the leaders of the Vendee, in 1799, and
then known as Grand-Jacques. [The Chouans.] One of the confidential
advisers of Louis XVIII. Field marshal, councillor of state,
comptroller of the extraordinary domains of the realm, deputy and peer
of France under Charles X.; decorated with the cross of the Legion of
Honor and the Order of Saint Louis. Head of one of the oldest houses
of Poitou. Had married a Mlle. de Kergarouet, who had no fortune, but
who came of a very old Brittany family related to the Rohans. Was the
father of three sons and three daughters. The oldest son became
president of a court, married the daughter of a multi-millionaire salt
merchant. The second son, a lieutenant-general, married Mlle. Monegod,
a rich banker's daughter whom the aunt of Duc d'Herouville had refused
to consider for her nephew. [Modeste Mignon.] The third son, director
of a Paris municipality, then director-general in the Department of
Finance, married the only daughter of M. Grossetete, receiver-general
at Bourges. Of the three daughters, the first married M. Planat at
Baudry, receiver-general; the second married Baron de Villaine, a
magistrate of bourgeois origin ennobled by the king; the third,
Emilie, married her old uncle, the Comte de Kergarouet, and after his
death, Marquis Charles de Vandenesse. [The Ball at Sceaux.] The Comte
de Fontaine and his family were present at the Birotteau ball, and
after the perfumer's bankruptcy procured a situation for him. [Cesar
Birotteau.] He died in 1824. [The Government Clerks.]

FONTAINE (Baronne de), born Anna Grossetete, only daughter of the
receiver-general of Bourges. Attended the school of Mlles. Chamarolles
with Dinah Piedefer, who became Mme. de la Baudraye. Thanks to her
fortune she married the third son of the Comte de Fontaine. She
removed to Paris after her marriage and kept up correspondence with
her old school-mate who now lived at Sancerre. She kept her informed
as to the prevailing styles. Later at the first performance of one of
Nathan's dramas, about the middle of the reign of Louis Philippe, Anna
de Fontaine affected not to recognize this same Mme. de la Baudraye,
then the known mistress of Etienne Lousteau. [The Muse of the
Department.]

FONTANIEU (Madame), friend and neighbor of Mme. Vernier at Vouvray in
1831. The jolliest gossip and greatest joker in town. She was present
at the interview between the insane Margaritis and Felix Gaudissart,
when the drummer was so much at sea. [Gaudissart the Great.]

FONTANON (Abbe), born about 1770. Canon of Bayeux cathedral in the
beginning of the nineteenth century when he "guided the consciences"
of Mme. and Mlle. Bontems. In November, 1808, he got himself enrolled
with the Parisian clergy, hoping thus to obtain a curacy and
eventually a bishopric. He became again the confessor of Mlle.
Bontems, now the wife of M. de Granville, and contributed to the
trouble of that household by the narrowness of his provincial
Catholicism and his inflexible bigotry. He finally disclosed to the
magistrate's wife the relations of Granville with Caroline Crochard.
He also brought sorrow to the last moments of Mme. Crochard, the
mother. [A Second Home.] In December, 1824, at Saint-Roch he
pronounced the funeral oration of Baron Flamet de la Billardiere. [The
Government Clerks.] Previous to 1824 Abbe Fontanon was vicar at the
church of Saint Paul, rue Saint-Antoine. [Honorine.] Confessor of Mme.
de Lanty in 1839, and always eager to pry into family secrets, he
undertook an affair with Dorlange-Sallenauve in the interest of
Mariannina de Lanty. [The Member for Arcis.]

FORTIN (Madame), mother of Mme. Marneffe. Mistress of General de
Montcornet, who had lavished money on her during his visits to Paris
which she had entirely squandered, under the Empire, in the wildest
dissipations. For twenty years she queened it, but died in poverty
though still believing herself rich. Her daughter inherited from her
the tastes of a courtesan. [Cousin Betty.]

FORTIN (Valerie), daughter of preceding and of General de Montcornet.
(See Crevel, Madame.)

FOSSEUSE (La), orphan daughter of a grave-digger, whence the nick-
name. Born in 1807. Frail, nervous, independent, retiring at first,
she tried hiring out, but then fell into vagrant habits. Reared in a
village on the outskirts of Grenoble, where Dr. Benassis came to live
during the Restoration, she became an object of special attention on
the part of the physician who became keenly interested in the gentle,
loyal, peculiar and impressionable creature. La Fosseuse though homely
was not without charm. She may have loved her benefactor. [The Country
Doctor.]

FOUCHE (Joseph), Duc d'Otrante, born near Nantes in 1753; died in
exile at Trieste in 1820. Oratorian, member of the National
Convention, councillor of state, minister of police under the
Consulate and Empire, also chief of the department of the Interior and
of the government of the Illyrian provinces, and president of the
provisional government in 1815. In September, 1799, Colonel Hulot
said: "Bernadotte, Carnot, even citizen Talleyrand--all have left us.
In a word we have with us but a single good patriot, friend Fouche,
who holds everything by means of the police. There's a man for you!"
Fouche took especial care of Corentin who was perhaps his natural son.
He sent him to Brittany during an uprising in the year VIII, to
accompany and direct Mlle. de Verneuil, who was commissioned to betray
and capture the Marquis de Montauran, the Chouan leader. [The
Chouans.] In 1806 he caused Senator Malin de Gondreville to be
kidnapped by masked men in order that the Chateau de Gondreville might
be searched for important papers which, however, proved as
compromising for Fouche as for the senator. This kidnapping, which was
charged against Michu, the Simeuses and the Hauteserres, led to the
execution of the first and the ruin of the others. In 1833, Marsay,
president of the ministerial chamber, while explaining the mysteries
of the affair to the Princesse de Cadignan, paid this tribute to
Fouche: "A genius dark, deep and extraordinary, little understood but
certainly the peer of Philip II., Tiberius or Borgia." [The
Gondreville Mystery.] In 1809 Fouche and Peyrade saved France in
connection with the Walcheren episode; but on the return of the
Emperor from the Wagram campaign Fouche was rewarded by dismissal.
[Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

FOUQUEREAU, concierge to M. Jules Desmarets, stock-broker, rue Menars
in 1820. Specially employed to look after Mme. Desmarets. [The
Thirteen.]

FOURCHON, retired farmer of the Ronquerolles estate, near the forest
of Aigues, Burgundy. Had also been a schoolmaster and a mail-carrier.
An old man and a confirmed toper since his wife's death. At Blangy in
1823 he performed the three-fold duties of public clerk for three
districts, assistant to a justice of the peace, and clarionet player.
At the same time he followed the trade of rope-maker with his
apprentice Mouche, the natural son of one of his natural daughters.
But his chief income was derived from catching otters. Fourchon was
the father-in-law of Tonsard, who ran the Grand-I-Vert tavern. [The
Peasantry.]

FOY (Maximilien-Sebastien), celebrated general and orator born in 1775
at Ham; died at Paris in 1825. [Cesar Birotteau.] In 1821, General
Foy, while in the shop of Dauriat talking with an editor of the
"Constitutionnel" and the manager of "La Minerve," noticed the beauty
of Lucien de Rubempre, who had come in with Lousteau to dispose of
some sonnets. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

FRAISIER, born about 1814, probably at Mantes. Son of a cobbler; an
advocate and man of business at No. 9 rue de la Perle, Paris, in
1844-45. Began as copy-clerk at Couture's office. After serving
Desroches as head-clerk for six years he bought the practice of
Levroux, an advocate of Mantes, where he had occasion to meet Leboeuf,
Vinet, Vatinelle and Bouyonnet. But he soon had to sell out and leave
town on account of violating professional ethics. Whereupon he opened
up a consultation office in Paris. A friend of Dr. Poulain who
attended the last days of Sylvain Pons, he gave crafty counsel to Mme.
Cibot, who coveted the chattels of the old bachelor. He also assured
the Camusot de Marvilles that they should be the legatees of the old
musician despite the faithful Schmucke. In 1845 he succeeded Vitel as
justice of the peace; the coveted place being secured for him by
Camusot de Marville, as a fee for his services. In Normandy he again
acted successfully for this family. Fraisier was a dried-up little man
with a blotched face and an unpleasant odor. At Mantes a certain Mme.
Vatinelle nevertheless "made eyes at him"; and he lived at Marais with
a servant-mistress, Dame Sauvage. But he missed more than one
marriage, not being able to win either his client, Mme. Florimond, or
the daughter of Tabareau. To tell the truth De Marville advised him to
leave the latter alone. [Cousin Pons.]

FRANCHESSINI (Colonel), born about 1789, served in the Imperial Guard,
and was one of the most dashing colonels of the Restoration, but was
forced to resign on account of a slur on his character. In 1808, to
provide for foolish expenditures into which a woman led him, he forged
certain notes. Jacques Collin--Vautrin--took the crime to himself and
was sent to the galleys for several years. In 1819 Franchessini killed
young Taillefer in a duel, at the instigation of Vautrin. The
following year he was with Lady Brandon--probably his mistress--at the
grand ball given by the Vicomtesse de Beauseant, just before her
flight. In 1839, Franchessini was a leading member of the Jockey club,
and held the rank of colonel in the National Guard. Married a rich
Irishwoman who was devout and charitable and lived in one of the
finest mansions of the Breda quarter. Elected deputy, and being an
intimate friend of Rastignac, he evinced open hostility for Sallenauve
and voted against his being seated in order to gratify Maxime de
Trailles. [Father Goriot. The Member for Arcis.]

FRANCOIS (Abbe), cure of the parish at Alencon in 1816. "A Cheverus on
a small scale" he had taken the constitutional oath during the
Revolution and for this reason was despised by the "ultras" of the
town although he was a model of charity and virtue. Abbe Francois
frequented the homes of M. and Mme. du Bousquier and M. and Mme.
Granson; but M. du Bousquier and Athanase Granson were the only ones
to give him cordial welcome. In his last days he became reconciled
with the curate of Saint-Leonard, Alencon's aristocratic church, and
died universally lamented. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

FRANCOIS, head valet to Marshal de Montcornet at Aigues in 1823.
Attached specially to Emile Blondet when the journalist visited them.
Salary twelve hundred francs. In his master's confidence. [The
Peasantry.]

FRANCOIS, in 1822, stage-driver between Paris and Beaumont-sur-Oise,
in the service of the Touchard Company. [A Start in Life.]

FRANCOISE, servant of Mme. Crochard, rue Saint-Louis in Marais in
1822. Toothless woman of thirty years' service. Was present at her
mistress' death-bed. This was the fourth she had buried. [A Second
Home.]

FRAPPART, in 1839, at Arcis-sur-Aube, proprietor of a dance-hall where
was held the primary, presided over by Colonel Giguet, which nominated
Sallenauve. [The Member for Arcis.]

FRAPPIER, finest carpenter in Provins in 1827-28. It was to him that
Jacques Brigaut came as apprentice when he went to the town to be near
his childhood's friend, Pierrette Lorrain. Frappier took care of her
when she left Rogron's house. Frappier was married. [Pierrette.]

FREDERIC, one of the editors of Finot's paper in 1821, who reported
the Theatre-Francais and the Odeon. [A Distinguished Provincial at
Paris.]

FRELU (La Grande), girl of Croisic who had a child by Simon Gaudry.
Nurse to Pierrette Cambremer whose mother died when she was very
young. [A Seaside Tragedy.]

FRESCONI, an Italian who, during the Restoration and until 1828, ran a
nursery on Boulevard du Montparnasse. The business was not a success.
Barbet the book-seller was interested in it; he turned it into a
lodging-house, where dwelt Baron Bourlac. [The Seamy Side of History.]

FRESQUIN, former supervisor of roads and bridges. Married and father
of a family. Employed, time of Louis Philippe, by Gregoire Gerard in
the hydraulic operations for Mme. Graslin at Montegnac. In 1843
Fresquin was appointed district tax collector. [The Country Parson.]

FRISCH (Samuel), Jewish jeweler on rue Saint-Avoie in 1829. Furnisher
and creditor of Esther Gobseck. A general pawnbroker. [Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.]

FRITAUD (Abbe), priest of Sancerre in 1836. [The Muse of the
Department.]

FRITOT, dealer in shawls on the stock exchange, Paris, time of Louis
Philippe. Rival of Gaudissart. He sold an absurd shawl for six
thousand francs to Mistress Noswell, an eccentric Englishwoman. Fritot
was once invited to dine with the King. [Gaudissart II.]

FRITOT (Madame), wife of preceding. [Gaudissart II.]

FROIDFROND (Marquis de), born about 1777. Gentleman of Maine-et-
Loire. While very young he became insolvent and sold his chateau near
Saumur, which was bought at a low price for Felix Grandet by Cruchot
the notary, in 1811. About 1827 the marquis was a widower with
children, and was spoken of as a possible peer of France. At this time
Mme. des Grassins tried to persuade Eugenie Grandet, now an orphan,
that she would do well to wed the marquis, and that this marriage was
a pet scheme of her father. And again in 1832 when Eugenie was left a
widow by Cruchot de Bonfons, the family of the marquis tried to
arrange a marriage with him. [Eugenie Grandet.]

FROMAGET, apothecary at Arcis-sur-Aube, time of Louis Philippe. As his
patronage did not extend to the Gondrevilles, he was disposed to work
against Keller; that is why he probably voted for Giguet in 1839. [The
Member for Arcis.]

FROMENTEAU, police-agent. With Contenson he had belonged to the
political police of Louis XVIII. In 1845 he aided in unearthing
prisoners for debt. Being encountered at the home of Theodore Gaillard
by Gazonal, he revealed some curious details concerning different
kinds of police to the bewildered countryman. [The Unconscious
Humorists.]

FUNCAL (Comte de), an assumed name of Bourignard, when he was met at
the Spanish Embassy, Paris, about 1820, by Henri de Marsay and Auguste
de Maulincour. There was a real Comte de Funcal, a Portuguese-
Brazilian, who had been a sailor, and whom Bourignard duplicated
exactly. He may have been "suppressed" violently by the usurper of his
name. [The Thirteen.]



G

GABILLEAU, deserter from the Seventeenth infantry; chauffeur executed
at Tulle, during the Empire, on the very day when he had planned an
escape. Was one of the accomplices of Farrabesche who profited by a
hole made in his dungeon by the condemned man to make his own escape.
[The Country Parson.]

GABRIEL, born about 1790; messenger at the Department of Finance, and
check-receiver at the Theatre Royal, during the Restoration. A
Savoyard, and nephew of Antoine, the oldest messenger in the
department. Husband of a skilled lace-maker and shawl-mender. He lived
with his uncle Antoine and another relative employed in the
department, Laurent. [The Government Clerks.]

GABUSSON, cashier in the employ of Dauriat the editor in 1821. [A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

GAILLARD (Theodore), journalist, proprietor or manager of newspapers.
In 1822 he and Hector Merlin established a Royalist paper in which
Rubempre, palinodist, aired opinions favorable to the existing
government, and slashed a very good book of his friend Daniel
d'Arthez. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] Under Louis Philippe
he was one of the owners of a very important political sheet.
[Beatrix. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.] In 1845 he ran a strong
paper. At first a man of wit, "he ended by becoming stupid on account
of staying in the same environment." He interlarded his speech with
epigrams from popular pieces, pronouncing them with the emphasis given
by famous actors. Gaillard was good with his Odry and still better
with Lemaitre. He lived at rue Menars. There he was met by Lora,
Bixiou and Gazonal. [The Unconscious Humorists.]

GAILLARD (Madame Theodore), born at Alencon about 1800. Given name
Suzanne. "A Norman beauty, fresh, blooming, and sturdy." One of the
employes of Mme. Lardot, the laundress, in 1816, the year when she
left her native town after having obtained some money of M. du
Bousquier by persuading him that she was with child by him. The
Chevalier de Valois liked Suzanne immensely, but did not allow himself
to be caught in this trap. Suzanne went to Paris and speedily became a
fashionable courtesan. Shortly thereafter she reappeared at Alencon
for a visit to attend Athanase Granson's funeral. She mourned with the
desolate mother, saying to her on leaving: "I loved him!" At the same
time she ridiculed the marriage of Mlle. Cormon with M. du Bousquier,
thus avenging the deceased and Chevalier de Valois. [Jealousies of a
Country Town.] Under the name of Mme. du Val-Noble she became noted in
the artistic and fashionable set. In 1821-22, she became the mistress
of Hector Merlin. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris. A Bachelor's
Establishment.] After having been maintained by Jacques Falleix, the
broker who failed, she was for a short time in 1830 mistress of
Peyrade who was concealed under the name of Samuel Johnson, "the
nabob." She was acquainted with Esther Gobseck, who lived on rue
Saint-Georges in a mansion that had been fitted up for her--Suzanne--
by Falleix, and obtained by Nucingen for Esther. [Scenes in a
Courtesan's Life.] In 1838 she married Theodore Gaillard her lover
since 1830. In 1845 she received Lora, Bixiou, and Gazonal. [Beatrix.
The Unconscious Humorists.]

GAILLARD, one of three guards who succeeded Courtecuisse, and under
the orders of Michaud, in the care of the estate of General de
Montcornet at Aigues. [The Peasantry.]

GALARD, market-gardener of Auteuil; father of Mme. Lemprun, maternal
grandfather of Mme. Jerome Thuillier. He died, very aged, of an
accident in 1817. [The Peasantry.]

GALARD (Mademoiselle), old maid, landed proprietor at Besancon, rue du
Perron. She let the first floor of her house to Albert Savarus, in
1834. [Albert Savarus.]

GALARDON (Madame), nee Tiphaine, elder sister of M. Tiphaine,
president of the court at Provins. Married at first to a Guenee, she
kept one of the largest retail dry-goods shops in Paris, on rue Saint-
Denis. Towards the end of the year 1815 she sold out to Rogron and
went back to Provins. She had three daughters whom she provided with
husbands in the little town: the eldest married M. Lesourd, king's
attorney; the second, M. Martener a physician; the third, M. Auffray a
notary. Finally she herself married for her second husband, M.
Galardon, receiver of taxes. She invariably added to her signature,
"nee Tiphaine." She defended Pierrette Lorrain, and was at outs with
the Liberals of Provins, who were induced to persecute Rogron's ward.
[Pierrette.]

GALATHIONNE (Prince and Princess), Russians. The prince was one of the
lovers of Diane de Maufrigneuse. [The Secrets of a Princess.] In
September, 1815, he protected La Minoret a celebrated opera dancer, to
whose daughter he gave a dowry. [The Middle Classes.] In 1819 Marsay,
appearing in the box of the Princess Galathionne, at the Italiens, had
Mme. de Nucingen at his mercy. [Father Goriot.] In 1821 Lousteau said
that the story of the Prince Galathionne's diamonds, the Maubreuil
affair and the Pombreton will, were fruitful newspaper topics. [A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] In 1834-35, the princess gave
balls which the Comtesse Felix de Vandenesse attended. [A Daughter of
Eve.] About 1840 the prince tried to get Mme. Schontz away from the
Marquis de Rochefide; but she said: "Prince, you are no handsomer, but
you are older than Rochefide. You would beat me, while he is like a
father to me." [Beatrix.]

GALOPE-CHOPINE. (See Cibot.)

GAMARD (Sophie), old maid; owner of a house at Tours on rue de la
Psalette, which backed the Saint Gatien church. She let part of it to
priests. Here lodged the Abbes Troubert, Chapeloud and Francois
Birotteau. The house had been purchased during the Terror by the
father of Mlle. Gamard, a dealer in wood, a kind of parvenu peasant.
After receiving Abbe Birotteau most cordially she took a disliking to
him which was secretly fostered by Troubert, and she finally
dispossessed him, seizing the furniture which he valued so greatly.
Mlle. Gamard died in 1826 of a chill. Troubert circulated the report
that Birotteau had caused her death by the sorrow which he had caused
the old maid. [The Vicar of Tours.]

GAMBARA (Paolo), musician, born at Cremona in 1791; son of an
instrument-maker, a moderately good performer and a great composer who
was driven from his home by the French and ruined by the war. These
events consigned Paolo Gambara to a wandering existence from the age
of ten. He found little quietude and obtained no congenial situation
till about 1813 in Venice. At this time he put on an opera, "Mahomet,"
at the Fenice theatre, which failed miserably. Nevertheless he
obtained the hand of Marianina, whom he loved, and with her wandered
through Germany to settle finally in Paris in 1831, in a wretched
apartment on rue Froidmanteau. The musician, an accomplished theorist,
could not interpret intelligently any of his remarkable ideas and he
would play to his wondering auditors jumbled compositions which he
thought to be sublime inspirations. However he enthusiastically
analyzed "Robert le Diable," having heard Meyerbeer's masterpiece
while a guest of Andrea Marcosini. In 1837 he was reduced to mending
musical instruments, and occasionally he went with his wife to sing
duets in the open air on the Champs-Elysees, to pick up a few sous.
Emilio and Massimilla de Varese were deeply sympathetic of the
Gambaras, whom they met in the neighborhood of Faubourg Saint-Honore.
Paolo Gambara had no commonsense except when drunk. He had invented an
outlandish instrument which he called the "panharmonicon." [Gambara.]

GAMBARA (Marianina), Venetian, wife of Paolo Gambara. With him she led
a life of almost continual poverty, and for a long time maintained
them at Paris by her needle. Her clients on rue Froidmanteau were
mostly profligate women, who however were kind and generous towards
her. From 1831 to 1836 she left her husband, going with a lover,
Andrea Marcosini, who abandoned her at the end of five years to marry
a dancer; and in January, 1837, she returned to her husband's home
emaciated, withered and faded, "a sort of nervous skeleton," to resume
a life of still greater squalor. [Gambara.]

GANDOLPHINI (Prince), Neapolitan, former partisan of King Murat. A
victim of the last Revolution he was, in 1823, banished and poverty
stricken. At this time he was sixty-five years old, though he looked
eighty. He lived modestly enough with his young wife at Gersau--
Lucerne--under the English name of Lovelace. He also passed for a
certain Lamporani, who was at that time a well-known publisher of
Milan. When in the presence of Rodolphe the prince resumed his true
self he said: "I know how to make up. I was an actor during the Empire
with Bourrienne, Mme. Murat, Mme. d'Abrantes, and any number of
others."--Character in a novel "L'Ambitieux par Amour," published by
Albert Savarus, in the "Revue de l'Est," in 1834. Under this
fictitious name the author related his own history: Rodolphe was
himself and the Prince and Princesse Gandolphini were the Duc and
Duchesse d'Argaiolo. [Albert Savarus.]

GANDOLPHINI (Princesse), nee Francesca Colonna, a Roman of illustrious
origin, fourth child of the Prince and Princess Colonna. While very
young she married Prince Gandolphini, one of the richest landed
proprietors of Sicily. Under the name of Miss Lovelace, she met
Rodolphe in Switzerland and he fell in love with her.--Heroine of a
novel entitled "L'Ambitieux par Amour," by Albert Savarus. [Albert
Savarus.]

GANIVET, bourgeois of Issoudun, In 1822, in a conversation where
Maxence Gilet was discussed, Commandant Potel threatened to make
Ganivet "swallow his tongue without sauce" if he continued to slander
the lover of Flore Brazier. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

GANIVET (Mademoiselle), a woman of Issoudun "as ugly as the seven
capital sins." Nevertheless she succeeded in winning a certain
Borniche-Hereau who in 1778 left her an income of a thousand crowns.
[A Bachelor's Establishment.]

GANNERAC, in transfer business at Angouleme. In 1821-22 he was
involved in the affair of the notes endorsed by Rubempre in imitation
of the signature of his brother-in-law Sechard. [Lost Illusions.]

GARANGEOT, in 1845 conducted the orchestra in a theatre run by Felix
Gaudissart, succeeding Sylvain Pons to the baton. Cousin of Heloise
Brisetout, who obtained the place for him. [Cousin Pons.]

GARCELAND, mayor of Provins during the Restoration. Son-in-law of
Guepin. Indirectly protected Pierrette Lorrain from the Liberals of
the village led by Maitre Vinet, who acted for Rogron. [Pierrette.]

GARCENAULT (De), first president of the Court of Besancon in 1834. He
got the chapter of the cathedral to secure Albert Savarus as counsel
in a lawsuit between the chapter and the city. Savarus won the suit.
[Albert Savarus.]

GARNERY, one of two special detectives in May, 1830, authorized by the
attorney-general, De Granville, to seize certain letters written to
Lucien de Rubempre by Mme. de Serizy, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and
Mlle. Clotilde de Grandlieu. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

GASNIER, peasant living near Grenoble; born about 1789. Married and
the father of several children whom he loved dearly. Inconsolable at
the loss of the eldest. Doctor Benassis, mayor of the commune,
mentioned this parental affection as a rare instance among tillers of
the soil. [The Country Doctor.]

GASSELIN, a Breton born in 1794; servant of the Guenics of Guerande,
in 1836, having been in their employ since he was fifteen. A short,
stout fellow with black hair, furrowed face; silent and slow. He took
care of the garden and stables. In 1832 in the foolish venture of
Duchesse de Berry, in which Gasselin took part with the Baron du
Guenic and his son Calyste, the faithful servant received a sabre cut
on the shoulder, while shielding the young man. This action seemed so
natural to the family that Gasselin received small thanks. [Beatrix.]

GASTON (Louis), elder natural son of Lady Brandon, born in 1805. Left
an orphan in the early years of the Restoration, he was, though still
a child, like a father to his younger brother Marie Gaston, whom he
placed in college at Tours; after which he himself shipped as cabin-
boy on a man-of-war. After being raised to the rank of captain of an
American ship and becoming wealthy in India, he died at Calcutta,
during the first part of the reign of Louis Philippe, as a result of
the failure of the "famous Halmer," and just as he was starting back
to France, married and happy. [La Grenadiere. Letters of Two Brides.]

GASTON (Marie), second natural son of Lady Brandon; born in 1810.
Educated at the college of Tours, which he quitted in 1827. Poet;
protege of Daniel d'Arthez, who often gave him food and shelter. In
1831 he met Louise de Chaulieu, the widow of Macumer, at the home of
Mme. d'Espard. He married her in October, 1833, though she was older
than he, and he was encumbered with debts amounting to 30,000 francs.
The couple living quietly at Ville-d'Avray, were happy until a day
when the jealous Louise conceived unjustifiable suspicions concerning
the fidelity of her husband; on which account she died after they had
been married two years. During these two years Gaston wrote at least
four plays. One of them written in collaboration with his wife was
presented with the greatest success under the names of Nathan and
"others." [La Grenadiere. Letters of Two Brides.] In his early youth
Gaston had published, at the expense of his friend Dorlange, a volume
of poetry, "Les Perce-neige," the entire edition of which found its
way, at three sous the volume, to a second-hand book-shop, whence, one
fine day, it inundated the quays from Pont Royal to Pont Marie. [The
Member for Arcis.]

GASTON (Madame Louis), an Englishwoman of cold, distant manners; wife
of Louis Gaston; probably married him in India where he died as a
result of unfortunate business deals. As a widow she came to France
with two children, where without resource she became a charge to her
brother-in-law who visited and aided her secretly. She lived in Paris
on rue de la Ville-Eveque. The visits made by Marie Gaston were spoken
of to his wife who became jealous, not knowing their object. Mme.
Louis Gaston was thus innocently the cause of Mme. Marie Gaston's
death. [Letters of Two Brides.]

GASTON (Madame Marie), born Armande-Louise-Marie de Chaulieu, in 1805.
At first destined to take the veil; educated at the Carmelite convent
of Blois with Renee de Maucombe who became Mme. de l'Estorade. She
remained constant in her relations with this faithful friend--at least
by letter--who was a prudent and wise adviser. In 1825 Louise married
her professor in Spanish, the Baron de Macumer, whom she lost in 1829.
In 1833 she married the poet Marie Gaston. Both marriages were
sterile. In the first she was adored and believed that she loved; in
the second she was loved as much as she loved, but her insane
jealousy, and her horseback rides from Ville-d'Avray to Verdier's were
her undoing, and she died in 1835 of consumption, contracted purposely
through despair at the thought that she had been deceived. After
leaving the convent she had lived successively at the following
places: on Faubourg Saint-Germain, Paris, where she saw M. de Bonald;
at Chantepleur, an estate in Burgundy, at La Crampade, in Provence,
with Mme. de l'Estorade; in Italy; at Ville-d'Avray, where she sleeps
her last sleep in a park of her own planning. [Letters of Two Brides.]

GATIENNE, servant of Mme. and Mlle. Bontems, at Bayeux, in 1805. [A
Second Home.]

GAUBERT, one of the most illustrious generals of the Republic; first
husband of a Mlle. de Ronquerolles whom he left a widow at the age of
twenty, making her his heir. She married again in 1806, choosing the
Comte de Serizy. [A Start in Life.]

GAUBERTIN (Francois), born about 1770; son of the ex-sheriff of
Soulanges, Burgundy, before the Revolution. About 1791, after five
years' clerkship to the steward of Mlle. Laguerre at Aigues, he
succeeded to the stewardship. His father having become public
prosecutor in the department, time of the Republic, he was made mayor
of Blangy. In 1796 he married the "citizeness" Isaure Mouchon, by whom
he had three children: a son, Claude, and two daughters, Jenny--Mme.
Leclercq--and Eliza. He had also a natural son, Bournier, whom he
placed in charge of a local newspaper. At the death of Mlle. Laguerre,
Gaubertin, after twenty-five years of stewardship, possessed 600,000
francs. He ended by dreaming of acquiring the estate at Aigues; but
the Comte de Montcornet purchased it, retained him in charge, caught
him one day in a theft and discharged him summarily. Gaubertin
received at that time sundry lashes with a whip of which he said
nothing, but for which he revenged himself. The old steward became,
nevertheless, a person of importance. In 1820 he was mayor of Ville-
aux-Fayes, and supplied one-third of the Paris wood. Being general
agent of this rural industry, he managed the forests, lumber and
guards. Gaubertin was related throughout a whole district, like a
"boa-constrictor twisted around a gigantic tree"; the church, the
magistracy, the municipality, the government--all did his bidding.
Even the peasantry served his interests indirectly. When the general,
disgusted by the numberless vexations of his estate, wished to sell
the property at Aigues, Gaubertin bought the forests, while his
partners, Rigou and Soudry, acquired the vineyards and other grounds.
[The Peasantry.]

GAUBERTIN (Madame), born Isaure Mouchon in 1778. Daughter of a member
of the Convention and friend of Gaubertin senior. Wife of Francois
Gaubertin. An affected creature of Ville-aux-Fayes who played the
great lady mightily. [The Peasantry.]

GAUBERTIN (Claude), son of Francois Gaubertin, godson of Mlle.
Laguerre, at whose expense he was educated at Paris. The busiest
attorney at Ville-aux-Fayes in 1823. After five years' practice he
spoke of selling his office. He probably became judge. [The
Peasantry.]

GAUBERTIN (Jenny), elder daughter of Francois Gaubertin. (See
Leclercq, Madame.)

GAUBERTIN (Elisa or Elise), second daughter of Francois Gaubertin.
Loved, courted and longed for since 1819 by the sub-prefect of Ville-
aux-Fayes, M. des Lupeaulx--the nephew. M. Lupin, notary at Soulanges,
sought on his part the young girl's hand for his only son Amaury. [The
Peasantry.]

GAUBERTIN-VALLAT (Mademoiselle), old maid, sister of Mme. Sibilet,
wife of the clerk of the court at Ville-aux-Fayes, in 1823. She ran
the town's stamp office. [The Peasantry.]

GAUCHER was in 1803 a boy working for Michu. [The Gondreville
Mystery.]

GAUDET, second clerk in Desroches' law office in 1824. [A Start in
Life.]

GAUDIN, chief of squadron in the mounted grenadiers of the Imperial
Guard; made baron of the Empire, with the estate of Wistchnau. Made
prisoner by Cossacks at the passage of the Beresina, he escaped, going
to India where he was lost sight of. However he returned to France
about 1830, in bad health, but a multi-millionaire. [The Magic Skin.]

GAUDIN (Madame), wife of foregoing, managed the Hotel Saint-Quentin,
rue des Cordiers, Paris, during the Restoration. Among her guests was
Raphael de Valentin. Her husband's return in 1830 made her wealthy and
a baroness. [The Magic Skin.]

GAUDIN (Pauline), daughter of the foregoing. Was acquainted with,
loved, and modestly aided Raphael de Valentin, a poor lodger at Hotel
Saint-Quintin. After the return of her father she lived with her
parents on rue Saint-Lazare. For a long time her whereabouts were
unknown to Raphael who had quitted the hotel abruptly; then he met her
again one evening at the Italiens. They fell into each other's arms,
declaring their mutual love. Raphael who also had become rich resolved
to espouse Pauline; but frightened by the shrinkage of the "magic
skin" he fled precipitately and returned to Paris. Pauline hastened
after him, only to behold him die upon her breast in a transport of
furious, impotent love. [The Magic Skin.]

GAUDISSART (Jean-Francois), father of Felix Gaudissart. [Cesar
Birotteau.]

GAUDISSART (Felix), native of Normandy, born about 1792, a "great"
commercial traveler making a specialty of the hat trade. Known to the
Finots, having been in the employ of the father of Andoche. Also
handled all the "articles of Paris." In 1816 he was arrested on the
denunciation of Peyrade--Pere Canquoelle. He had imprudently conversed
in the David cafe with a retired officer concerning a conspiracy
against the Bourbons that was about to break out. Thus the conspiracy
was thwarted and two men were sent to the scaffold. Gaudissart being
released by Judge Popinot was ever after grateful to the magistrate
and devoted to the interests of his nephew. When he became minister,
Anselme Popinot obtained for Gaudissart license for a large theatre on
the boulevard, which in 1834 aimed to supply the demand for popular
opera. This theatre employed Sylvain Pons, Schmucke, Schwab, Garangeot
and Heloise Brisetout, Felix's mistress. [Scenes from a Courtesan's
Life. Cousin Pons.] "Gaudissart the Great," then a young man, attended
the Birotteau ball. About that time he probably lived on rue des Deux-
Ecus, Paris. [Cesar Birotteau.] During the Restoration, a "pretended
florist's agent" sent by Judge Popinot to Comte Octave de Bauvan, he
bought at exorbitant prices the artificial flowers made by Honorine.
[Honorine.] At Vouvray in 1831 this man, so accustomed to fool others,
was himself mystified in rather an amusing manner by a retired dyer, a
sort of "country Figaro" named Vernier. A bloodless duel resulted.
After the episode, Gaudissart boasted that the affair had been to his
advantage. He was "in this Saint-Simonian period" the lover of Jenny
Courand. [Gaudissart the Great.]

GAUDRON (Abbe), an Auvergnat; vicar and then curate of the church of
Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis, rue Saint-Antoine, Paris, during the
Restoration and the Government of July. A peasant filled with faith,
square below and above, a "sacerdotal ox" utterly ignorant of the
world and of literature. Being confessor of Isidore Baudoyer he
endeavored in 1824 to further the promotion of that incapable chief of
bureau in the Department of Finance. In the same year he was present
at a dinner at the Comte de Bauvan's when were discussed questions
relating to woman. [The Government Clerks. Honorine.] In 1826 Abbe
Gaudron confessed Mme. Clapart and led her into devout paths; the
former Aspasia of the Directory had not confessed for forty years. In
February, 1830, the priest obtained the Dauphiness' protection for
Oscar Husson, son of Mme. Clapart by her first husband, and that young
man was promoted to a sub-lieutenancy in a regiment where he had been
serving as subaltern. [A Start in Life.]

GAULT, warden of the Conciergerie in May, 1830, when Jacques Collin
and Rubempre were imprisoned there. He was then aged. [Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life.]

GAY, boot-maker in Paris, rue de la Michodiere, in 1821, who furnished
the boots for Rubempre which aroused Matifat's suspicion. [A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

GAZONAL (Sylvestre-Palafox-Castel), one of the most skillful weavers
in the Eastern Pyrenees; commandant of the National Guard, September,
1795. On a visit to Paris in 1845 for the settlement of an important
lawsuit he sought out his cousin, Leon de Lora, the landscape artist,
who in one day, with Bixiou the caricaturist, showed him the under
side of the city, opening up to him a whole gallery full of
"unconscious humorists"--dancers, actresses, police-agents, etc.
Thanks to his two cicerones, he won his lawsuit and returned home.
[The Unconscious Humorists.]

GENDRIN, caricaturist, tenant of M. Molineux, Cour Batave, in 1818.
According to his landlord, the artist was a profoundly immoral man who
drew caricatures against the government, brought bad women home with
him and made the hall uninhabitable. [Cesar Birotteau.]

GENDRIN, brother-in-law of Gaubertin the steward of Aigues. He also
had married a daughter of Mouchon. Formerly an attorney, then for a
long time a judge of the Court of First Instance at Ville-aux-Fayes,
he at last became president of the court, through the influence of
Comte de Soulanges, under the Restoration. [The Peasantry.]

GENDRIN, court counselor of a departmental seat in Burgundy, and a
distant relative of President Gendrin. [The Peasantry.]

GENDRIN, only son of President Gendrin; recorder of mortgages in that
sub-prefecture in 1823. [The Peasantry.]

GENDRIN-WATTEBLED (or Vatebled), born about 1733. General supervisor
of streams and forests at Soulanges, Burgundy, from the reign of Louis
XV. Was still in office in 1823. A nonagenarian he spoke, in his lucid
moments, of the jurisdiction of the Marble Table. He reigned over
Soulanges before Mme. Soudry's advent. [The Peasantry.]

GENESTAS (Pierre-Joseph), cavalry officer, born in 1779. At first a
regimental lad, then a soldier. Sub-lieutenant in 1802; officer of the
Legion of Honor after the battle of Moskowa; chief of squadron in
1829. In 1814 he married the widow of his friend Renard, a subaltern.
She died soon after, leaving a child that was legally recognized by
Genestas, who entrusted him, then a young man, to the care of Dr.
Benassis. In December, 1829, Genestas was promoted to be a lieutenant-
colonel in a regiment quartered at Poitiers. [The Country Doctor.]

GENESTAS (Madame Judith), Polish Jewess, born in 1795. Married in 1812
after the Sarmatian custom to her lover Renard, a French
quartermaster, who was killed in 1813. Judith gave him one son,
Adrien, and survived the father one year. /In extremis/ she married
Genestas a former lover, who adopted Adrien. [The Country Doctor.]

GENESTAS (Adrien), adopted son of Commandant Genestas, born in 1813 to
Judith the Polish Jewess and Renard who was killed before the birth of
his son. Adrien was a living picture of his mother--olive complexion,
beautiful black eyes of a spirituelle sadness, and a head of hair too
heavy for his frail body. When sixteen he seemed but twelve. He had
fallen into bad habits, but after living with Dr. Benassis for eight
months, he was cured and became robust. [The Country Doctor.]

GENEVIEVE, an idiotic peasant girl, ugly and comparatively rich.
Friend and companion of the Comtesse de Vandieres, then insane and an
inmate of the asylum of Bons-Hommes, near Isle-Adam, during the
Restoration. Jilted by a mason, Dallot, who had promised to marry her,
Genevieve lost what little sense love had aroused in her. [Farewell.]

GENOVESE, tenor at the Fenice theatre, Venice, in 1820. Born at
Bergamo in 1797. Pupil of Veluti. Having long loved La Tinti, he sang
outrageously in her presence, so long as she resisted his advances,
but regained all his powers after she yielded to him. [Massimilla
Doni.] In the winter of 1823-24, at the home of Prince Gandolphini, in
Geneva, Genovese sang with his mistress, an exiled Italian prince, and
Princess Gandolphini, the famous quartette, "Mi manca la voce."
[Albert Savarus.]

GENTIL, old valet in service of Mme. de Bargeton, during the
Restoration. During the summer of 1821, with Albertine and Lucien de
Rubempre, he accompanied his mistress to Paris. [A Distinguished
Provincial at Paris.]

GENTILLET, sold in 1835 an old diligence to Albert Savarus when the
latter was leaving Besancon after the visit on the part of Prince
Soderini. [Albert Savarus.]

GENTILLET (Madame), maternal grandmother of Felix Grandet. She died in
1806 leaving considerable property. In Grandet's "drawing room" at
Saumur was a pastel of Mme. Gentillet, representing her as a
shepherdess. [Eugenie Grandet.]

GEORGES, confidential valet of Baron de Nucingen, at Paris, time of
Charles X. Knew of his aged master's love affairs and aided or
thwarted him at will. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

GERARD (Francois-Pascal-Simon, Baron), celebrated painter--1770-1837--
procured for Joseph Bridau in 1818 two copies of Louis XVIII.'s
portrait which were worth to the beginner, then very poor, a thousand
francs, a tidy sum for the Bridau family. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.] The Parisian salon of Gerard, much sought after, had a
rival at Chaussee-d'Antin in that of Mlle. de Touches. [Beatrix.]

GERARD, adjutant-general of the Seventy-second demi-brigade, commanded
by Hulot. A careful education had developed a superior intellect in
Gerard. He was a staunch Republican. Killed by the Chouan, Pille-
Miche, at Vivetiere, December 1799. [The Chouans.]

GERARD (Gregoire), born in 1802, probably in Limousin. Protestant of
somewhat uncouth exterior, son of a journeyman carpenter who died when
rather young; godson of F. Grossetete. From the age of twelve the
banker had encouraged him in the study of the exact sciences for which
he had natural aptitude. Studied at Ecole Polytechnique from nineteen
to twenty-one; then entered as a pupil of engineering in the National
School of Roads and Bridges, from which he emerged in 1826 and stood
the examinations for ordinary engineer two years later. He was cool-
headed and warm-hearted. He became disgusted with his profession when
he ascertained its many limitations, and he plunged into the July
(1830) Revolution. He was probably on the point of adopting the Saint-
Simonian doctrine, when M. Grossetete prevailed upon him to take
charge of some important works on the estate of Mme. Pierre Graslin in
Haute-Vienne. Gerard wrought wonders aided by Fresquin and other
capable men. He became mayor of Montegnac in 1838. Mme. Graslin died
about 1844. Gerard followed out her final wishes, and lived with her
children, assuming guardianship of Francis Graslin. Three months
later, again furthering the desires of the deceased, Gerard married a
native girl, Denise Tascheron, the sister of a man who had been
executed in 1829. [The Country Parson.]

GERARD (Madame Gregoire), wife of foregoing, born Denise Tascheron, of
Montegnac, Limousin; youngest child of a rather large family. She
lavished her sisterly affection on her brother, the condemned
Tasheron, visiting him in prison and softening his savage nature. With
the aid of another brother, Louis-Marie, she made away with certain
compromising clues of her eldest brother's crime, and restored the
stolen money, afterwards she emigrated to America, where she became
wealthy. Becoming homesick she returned to Montegnac, fifteen years
later, where she recognized Francis Graslin, her brother's natural
son, and became a second mother to him when she married the engineer,
Gerard. This marriage of a Protestant with a Catholic took place in
1844. "In grace, modesty, piety and beauty, Mme. Gerard resembled the
heroine of 'Edinburgh Prison.' " [The Country Parson.]

GERARD (Madame), widow, poor but honest, mother of several grown-up
daughters; kept a furnished hotel on rue Louis-le-Grand, Paris, about
the end of the Restoration. Being under obligations to Suzanne du Val-
Noble--Mme. Theodore Gaillard--she sheltered her when the courtesan
was driven away from a fine apartment on rue Saint-Georges, following
the ruin and flight of her lover, Jacques Falleix, the stockbroker.
Mme. Gerard was not related to the other Gerards mentioned above.
[Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

GIARDINI, Neapolitan cook somewhat aged. He and his wife ran a
restaurant in rue Froidmanteau, Paris, in 1830-31. He had established,
so he said, three restaurants in Italy: at Naples, Parma and Rome. In
the first years of Louis Philippe's reign, his peculiar cookery was
the fare of Paolo Gambara. In 1837 this crank on the subject of
special dishes had fallen to the calling of broken food huckster on
rue Froidmanteau. [Gambara.]

GIBOULARD (Gatienne), a very pretty daughter of a wealthy carpenter of
Auxerre; vainly desired, about 1823, by Sarcus for wife, but his
father, Sarcus the Rich, would not consent. Later the social set of
Mme. Soudry, the leading one of a neighboring village, dreamed for a
moment of avenging themselves on the people of Aigues by winning over
Gatienne Giboulard. She could have embroiled M. and Mme. Montcornet,
and perhaps even compromised Abbe Brossette. [The Peasantry.]

GIGELMI, Italian orchestra conductor, living in Paris with the
Gambaras. After the Revolution of 1830, he dined at Giardini's on rue
Froidmanteau. [Gambara.]

GIGONNET. (See Bidault.]

GIGUET (Colonel), native probably of Arcis-sur-Aube, where he lived
after retirement. One of Mme. Marion's brothers. One of the most
highly esteemed officers of the Grand Army. Had a fine sense of honor;
was for eleven years merely captain of artillery; chief of battalion
in 1813; major in 1814. On account of devotion to Napoleon he refused
to serve the Bourbons after the first abdication; and he gave such
proofs of his fidelity in 1815, that he would have been exiled had it
not been for the Comte de Gondreville, who obtained for him retirement
on half-pay with the rank of colonel. About 1806 he married one of the
daughters of a wealthy Hamburg banker, who gave him three children and
died in 1814. Between 1818 and 1825 Giguet lost the two younger
children, a son named Simon alone surviving. A Bonapartist and
Liberal, the colonel was, during the Restoration, president of the
committee at Arcis, where he came in touch with Grevin, Beauvisage and
Varlet, notables of the same stamp. He abandoned active politics after
his ideas triumphed, and, during the reign of Louis Philippe, he
became a noted horticulturist, the creator of the famous Giguet rose.
Nevertheless the colonel continued to be the god of his sister's very
influential salon where he appeared at the time of the legislative
elections of 1839. In the first part of May of that year the little
old man, wonderfully preserved, presided over an electoral convention
at Frappart's, the candidates in the field being his own son, Simon
Giguet, Phileas Beauvisage, and Sallenauve-Dorlange. [The Member for
Arcis.]

GIGUET (Colonel), brother of the preceding and of Mme. Marion; was
brigadier of gendarmes at Arcis-sur-Aube in 1803; promoted to a
lieutenancy in 1806. As brigadier Giguet was one of the most
experienced men in the service. The commandant of Troyes mentioned him
especially to the two Parisian detectives, Peyrade and Corentin,
entrusted with watching the actions of the Simeuses and the
Hauteserres which resulted in the ruin of these young Royalists on
account of the pretended seizure of Gondreville. However, an adroit
manoeuvre on the part of Francois Michu at first prevented Brigadier
Giguet from seizing these conspirators whom he had tracked to earth.
After his promotion to lieutenant he succeeded in arresting them. He
finally became colonel of the gendarmes of Troyes, whither Mme.
Marion, then Mlle. Giguet, went with him. He died before his brother
and sister, and made her his heir. [The Gondreville Mystery. The
Member for Arcis.]

GIGUET (Simon), born during the first Empire, the oldest and only
surviving child of Colonel Giguet of the artillery. In 1814 he lost
his mother, the daughter of a rich Hamburg banker, and in 1826 his
maternal grandfather who left him an income of two thousand francs,
the German having favored others of the large family. He did not hope
for any further inheritance save that of his father's sister, Mme.
Marion, which had been augmented by the legacy of Colonel Giguet of
the gendarmes. Thus it was that, after studying law with the
subprefect Antonin Goulard, Simon Giguet, deprived of a fortune which
at first seemed assured to him, became a simple attorney in the little
town of Arcis, where attorneys are of little service. His aunt's and
his father's position fired him with ambition for a political career.
Giguet ogled at the same time for the hand and dowry of Cecile
Beauvisage. Of mediocre ability; upheld the Left Centre, but failed of
election in May, 1839, when he presented himself as candidate for
Arcis-sur-Aube. [The Member for Arcis.]

GILET (Maxence), born in 1789. He passed at Issoudun for the natural
son of Lousteau, the sub-delegate. Others thought him the son of Dr.
Rouget, a friend and rival of Lousteau. In short "fortunately for the
child both claimed him"; though he belonged to neither. His true
father was found to be a "charming officer of dragoons in the garrison
at Bourges." His mother, the wife of a poor drunken cobbler of
Issoudun, had the marvelous beauty of a Transteverin. Her husband was
aware of his wife's actions and profited by them: through interested
motives, Lousteau and Rouget were allowed to believe whatever they
wished about the child's paternity, for which reason both contributed
to the education of Maxence, usually known as Max. In 1806, at the age
of seventeen, Max enlisted in a regiment going to Spain. In 1809 he
was left for dead in Portugal in an English battery; taken by the
English and conveyed to the Spanish prison-hulks at Cabrera. There he
remained from 1810 to 1814. When he returned to Issoudun his father
and his mother had both died in the hospital. On the return of
Bonaparte, Max served as captain in the Imperial Guard. During the
second Restoration he returned to Issoudun and became leader of the
"Knights of Idlesse" which were addicted to nocturnal escapades more
or less agreeable to the inhabitants of the town. "Max played at
Issoudun a part almost identical with that of Smith in 'The Fair Maid
of Perth'; he was the champion of Bonapartism and opposition. They
relied upon him, as the citizens of Perth had relied upon Smith on
great occasions." A possible Caesar Borgia on more extensive ground,
Gilet lived very comfortably, although without a personal income. And
that is why Max with certain inherited qualities and defects rashly
went to live with his supposed natural father, Jean-Jacques Rouget, a
rich and witless old bachelor who was under the thumb of a superb
servant-mistress, Flore Brazier, known as La Rabouilleuse. After 1816
Gilet lorded it over the household; the handsome chap had won the
heart of Mlle. Brazier. Surrounded by a sort of staff, Maxence
contested the important inheritance of Rouget, maintaining his ground
with marvelous skill against the two lawful heirs, Agathe and Joseph
Bridau; and he would have appropriated it but for the intervention of
a third heir, Philippe Bridau. Max was killed in a duel by Philippe
Bridau in the early part of December, 1822. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

GILLE, once printer to the Emperor; owner of script letters which
Jerome-Nicolas Sechard made use of in 1819, claiming for them that
they were the ancestors of the English type of Didot. [Lost
Illusions.]

GINA, character in "L'Ambitieux par Amour," autobiographical novel by
Albert Savarus; a sort of "ferocious" Sormano. Represented as a young
Sicilian girl, fourteen years old, in the services of the
Gandolphinis, political refugees at Gersau, Switzerland, in 1823. So
devoted as to pretend dumbness on occasion, and to wound more or less
seriously the hero of the romance, Rodolphe, who had secretly entered
the Gandolphini home. [Albert Savarus.]

GINETTA (La), young Corsican girl. Very small and slender, but no less
clever. Mistress of Theodore Calvi, and an accomplice in the double
crime committed by her lover, towards the end of the Restoration, when
she was able on account of her small size to creep down an open
chimney at the widow Pigeau's, and thus to open the house door for
Theodore who robbed and murdered the two inmates, the widow and the
servant. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

GIRARD, banker and discounter at Paris during the Restoration; perhaps
also somewhat of a pawnbroker; an acquaintance of Esther Gobseck's.
Like Palma, Werbrust and Gigonnet, he held a number of notes signed by
Maxime de Trailles; and Gobseck who knew it used them against the
count, then the lover of Mme. de Restaud, when Trailles went to the
usurer in rue des Gres and besought assistance in vain. [Gobseck.]

GIRARD (Mother), who ran a little restaurant at Paris in rue de
Tournon, prior to 1838, had a successor with whom Godefroid promised
to board when he was inspecting the left bank of the Seine, and trying
to aid the Bourlac-Mergis. [The Seamy Side of History.]

GIRARDET, attorney at Besancon, between 1830 and 1840. A talkative
fellow and adherent of Albert Savarus, he followed, probably in the
latter's interest, the beginning of the Watteville suit. When Savarus
left Besancon suddenly, Girardet tried to straighten out his
colleague's affairs, and advanced him five thousand francs. [Albert
Savarus.]

GIRAUD (Leon), was at Paris in 1821 member of the Cenacle of rue des
Quatre-Vents, presided over by Daniel d'Arthez. He represented the
philosophical element. His "doctrines" predicted the end of
Christianity and of the family. In 1821 he was also in charge of a
"grave and dignified" opposition journal. He became the head of a
moral and political school, whose "sincerity atoned for its errors."
[A Distinguished Provincial at Paris.] About the same time Giraud
frequented the home of the mother of his friend Joseph Bridau, and was
going there at the time when the painter's elder brother, the
Bonapartist Philippe, got into trouble. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]
The Revolution of July opened the political career of Leon Giraud who
became master of requests in 1832, and afterwards councillor of state.
In 1845 Giraud was a member of the Chamber, sitting in the Left
Centre. [The Secrets of a Princess. The Unconscious Humorists.]

GIREL, of Troyes. According to Michu, Girel, a Royalist like himself,
during the first Revolution, played the Jacobin in the interest of his
fortune. From 1803 to 1806, at any rate, he was in correspondence with
the Strasbourg house of Breintmayer, which dealt with the Simeuse
twins when they were tracked by Bonaparte's police. [The Gondreville
Mystery.]

GIRODET (Anne-Louis), celebrated painter, born at Montargis, in 1767,
died at Paris in 1824. Under the Empire he was on friendly terms with
his colleague, Theodore de Sommervieux. One day in the latter's studio
he greatly admired a portrait of Augustine Guillaume and an interior,
which he advised him, but in vain not to exhibit at the Salon,
thinking the two works too true to nature to be appreciated by the
public. [At the Sign of the Cat and Racket.]

GIROUD (Abbe), confessor of Rosalie de Watteville at Besancon between
1830 and 1840. [Albert Savarus.]

GIROUDEAU, born about 1774. Uncle of Andoche Finot; began as simple
soldier in the army of Sambre and Meuse; five years master-at-arms in
the First Hussars--army of Italy; charged at Eylau with Colonel
Chabert. He passed into the dragoons of the Imperial Guard, where he
was captain in 1815. The Restoration interrupted his military career.
Finot, manager of various Parisian papers and reviews, put him in
charge of the cash and accounts of a little journal devoted to
dramatic news, which he ran from 1821 to 1822. Giroudeau was also
editor, and his duty it was to wage the warfare; beyond that he lived
a gay life. Although on the wrong side of forty and afflicted with
catarrh he had for mistress Florentine Cabirolle of the Gaite. He went
with the high-livers--among others with his former mess-mate Philippe
Bridau, at whose wedding with Flore Brazier he was present in 1824. In
November, 1825, Frederic Marest gave a grand breakfast to Desroches'
clerks at the Rocher de Cancale, to which Giroudeau was invited. All
spent the evening with Florentine Cabirolle who entertained them
royally but involuntarily got Oscar Husson into trouble. Ex-Captain
Giroudeau bore firearms during the "three glorious days," re-entered
the service after the accession of citizen royalty and soon became
colonel then general, 1834-35. At this time he was enabled to satisfy
a legitimate resentment against his former friend, Bridau, and block
his advancement. [A Distinguished Provincial at Paris. A Start in
Life. A Bachelor's Establishment.]

GIVRY, one of several names of the second son of the Duc de Chaulieu,
who became by his marriage with Madeleine de Mortsauf a Lenoncourt-
Givry-Chaulieu. [Letters of Two Brides. The Lily of the Valley. Scenes
from a Courtesan's Life.]

GOBAIN (Madame Marie), formerly cook to a bishop; lived during the
Restoration in Paris on rue Saint-Maur, Popinot quarter, under very
peculiar circumstances. She was in the service of Octave de Bauvan.
Was the maid and housekeeper of Comtesse Honorine when the latter left
home and became a maker of artificial flowers. Mme. Gobain had been
secretly engaged by M. de Bauvan, who through her was enabled to keep
watch over his wife. Gobain displayed the greatest loyalty. At one
time the comtesse took the servant's name. [Honorine.]

GOBENHEIM, brother-in-law of Francois and Adolphe Keller, whose name
he added to his own. About 1819 in Paris he was at first made receiver
in the Cesar Birotteau bankruptcy, but was later replaced by Camusot.
[Cesar Birotteau.] Under Louis Philippe, Gobenheim, as broker for the
Paris prosecuting office, invested the very considerable savings of
Mme. Fabien du Ronceret. [Beatrix.]

GOBENHEIM, nephew of Gobenheim-Keller of Paris; young banker of Havre
in 1829; visited the Mignons, but not as a suitor for the heiress'
hand. [Modeste Mignon.]

GOBET (Madame), in 1829 at Havre made shoes for Mme. and Mlle. Mignon.
Was scolded by the latter for lack of style. [Modeste Mignon.]

GOBSECK (Jean-Esther Van), usurer, born in 1740 at Antwerp of a Jewess
and a Dutchman. Began as a cabin-boy. Was only ten years of age when
his mother sent him off to the Dutch possessions in India. There and
in America he met distinguished people, also several corsairs;
traveled all over the world and tried many trades. The passion for
money took entire hold of him. Finally he came to Paris which became
the centre of his operations, and established himself on rue des Gres.
There Gobseck, like a spider in his web, crushed the pride of Maxime
de Trailles and brought tears to the eyes of Mme. de Restaud and Jean-
Joachim Goriot--1819. About this same time Ferdinand du Tillet sought
out the money-lender to make some deals with him, and spoke of him as
"Gobseck the Great, master of Palma, Gigonnet, Werbrust, Keller and
Nucingen." Gobseck went every evening to the Themis cafe to play
dominoes with his friend Bidault-Gigonnet. In December, 1824, he was
found there by Elisabeth Baudoyer, whom he promised to aid; indeed,
supported by Mitral, he was able to influence Lupeaulx to put in
Isidore Baudoyer as chief of division succeeding La Billardiere. In
1830, Gobseck, then an octogenarian, died in his wretched hole on rue
des Gres though he was enormously wealthy. Derville received his last
wishes. He had obtained a wife for the lawyer and entrusted him with
several confidences. Fifteen years after the Dutchman's death, he was
spoken of on the boulevard as the "Last of the Romans"--among the old-
fashioned money-lenders like Gigonnet, Chaboisseau, and Samanon,
against whom Lora and Bixiou set the modern Vauvinet. [Gobseck. Father
Goriot. Cesar Birotteau. The Government Clerks. The Unconscious
Humorists.]

GOBSECK (Sarah Van), called "La Belle Hollandaise." A peculiarity of
this family--as well as the Maranas--that the female side always kept
the family name. Thus Sarah Van Gobseck was the grand-niece of Jean-
Esther Van Gobseck. This prostitute, mother of Esther, who was also a
courtesan, was a typical daughter of Paris. She caused the bankruptcy
of Roguin, Birotteau's attorney, and was herself ruined by Maxime de
Trailles whom she adored and maintained when he was a page to
Napoleon. She died in a house on Palais-Royal, the victim of a love-
mad captain, December, 1818. The affair created a stir. Juan and
Francis Diard had something to say about it. Esther's name lived after
her. The Paris of the boulevards from 1824 to 1839 often mentioned her
prodigal and stormy career. [Gobseck. Cesar Birotteau. The Maranas.
Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. The Member for Arcis.]

GOBSECK (Esther Van), born in 1805 of Jewish origin; daughter of the
preceding and great-grand-niece of Jean. For a long time in Paris she
followed her mother's calling, and having begun it early in life she
knew its varied phases. Was nick-named "La Torpille." Was for some
time one of the "rats" of the Royal Academy of Music, and numbered
among her protectors, Lupeaulx. In 1823 her reduced circumstances
almost forced her to leave Paris for Issoudun, where, for a
machiavellian purpose, Philippe Bridau would have made her the
mistress of Jean-Jacques Rouget. The affair did not materialize. She
went to Mme. Meynardie's house where she remained till about the end
of 1823. One evening, while passing the Porte-Saint-Martin theatre,
she chanced to meet Lucien de Rubempre, and they loved each other at
first sight. Their passion led into many vicissitudes. The poet and
the ex-prostitute were rash enough to attend an Opera ball together in
the winter of 1824. Unmasked and insulted Esther fled to rue de
Langlade, where she lived in dire poverty. The dangerous, powerful and
mysterious protector of Rubempre, Jacques Collin, followed her there,
lectured her and shaped her future life, making her a Catholic,
educating her carefully and finally installing her with Lucien on rue
Taitbout, under the surveillance of Jacqueline Collin, Paccard and
Prudence Servien. She could go out only at night. Nevertheless, the
Baron de Nucingen discovered her and fell madly in love with her.
Jacques Collin profited by the episode; Esther received the banker's
attentions, to the enrichment of Lucien. In 1830 she owned a house on
rue Saint-Georges which had belonged previously to several celebrated
courtesans; there she received Mme. du Val-Noble, Tullia and
Florentine--two dancers, Fanny Beaupre and Florine--two actresses. Her
new position resulted in police intervention on the part of Louchard,
Contenson, Peyrade and Corentin. On May 13, 1830, unable longer to
endure Nucingen, La Torpille swallowed a Javanese poison. She died
without knowing that she had fallen heir to seven millions left by her
great-grand-uncle. [Gobseck. The Firm of Nucingen. A Bachelor's
Establishment. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

GODAIN, born in 1796, in Burgundy, near Soulanges, Blangy and Ville-
aux-Fayes; nephew of one of the masons who built Mme. Soudry's house.
A shiftless farm laborer, exempt from military duty on account of
smallness of stature; was at first the lover, then the husband, of
Catherine Tonsard, whom he married about 1823. [The Peasantry.]

GODAIN (Madame Catherine), the eldest of the legitimate daughters of
Tonsard, landlord of the Grand-I-Vert, situated between Conches and
Ville-aux-Fayes in Burgundy. Of coarse beauty and by nature depraved;
a hanger-on at the Tivoli-Socquard, and a devoted sister to Nicolas
Tonsard for whom she tried to obtain Genevieve Niseron. Courted by
Charles, valet at Aigues. Feared by Amaury Lupin. Married Godain one
of her lovers, giving a dowry of a thousand francs cunningly obtained
from Mme. Montcornet. [The Peasantry.]

GODARD (Joseph), born in 1798, probably at Paris; related slightly to
the Baudoyers through Mitral. Stunted and puny; fifer in the National
Guard; "crank" collector of curios; a virtuous bachelor living with
his sister, a florist on rue Richelieu. Between 1824 and 1825 a
possible assistant in the Department of Finance in the bureau managed
by Isidore Baudoyer, whose son-in-law he dreamed of becoming. An easy
mark for Bixiou's practical jokes. With Dutocq he was an unwavering
adherent of the Baudoyers and their relatives the Saillards. [The
Government Clerks. The Middle Classes.]

GODARD (Mademoiselle), sister of the foregoing, and lived on rue
Richelieu, Pais, where in 1824 she ran a florist's shop. Mlle. Godard
employed Zelie Lorain who became later the wife of Minard. She
received him and Dutocq. [The Government Clerks.]

GODARD (Manon), serving-woman of Mme. de la Chanterie; arrested in
1809, between Alencon and Mortagne, implicated in the Chauffeurs trial
which ended in the capital punishment of Mme. des Tours-Minieres,
daughter of Mme. de la Chanterie. Manon Godard was sentenced by
default to twenty-two years imprisonment, and gave herself up in order
not to abandon her mistress. A long time after the baroness was set
free, time of Louis Philippe, Manon was still living with her, on rue
Chanoinesse, in the house which sheltered Alain, Montauran and
Godefroid. [The Seamy Side of History.]

GODDET, retired surgeon-major of the Third regiment of the line; the
leading physician of Issoudun in 1823. His son was one of the "Knights
of Idlesse." Goddet junior pretended to pay court to Mme. Fichet, in
order to reach her daughter who had the best dowry in Issoudun. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

GODEFROID, known by his given name; born about 1806, probably at
Paris; son of a wealthy merchant; educated at the Liautard
Institution; naturally feeble, morally and physically; tried his hand
at and made a failure of: law, governmental work, letters, pleasure,
journalism, politics and marriage. At the close of 1836 he found
himself poor and forsaken; thereupon he tried to pay his debts and
live economically. He left Chaussee-d'Antin and took up his abode on
rue Chanoinesse, where he became one of Mme. de la Chanteries'
boarders, known as the "Brotherhood of the Consolation." The
recommendation of the Monegods, bankers, led to his admission. Abbe de
Veze, Montauran, Tresnes, Alain, and above all the baroness initiated
him, coached him, and entrusted to him various charitable missions.
Among others, about the middle of the reign of Louis Philippe, he took
charge of and relieved the frightful poverty of the Bourlacs and the
Mergis, the head of which as an imperial judge in 1809 had sentenced
Mme. de la Chanterie and her daughter. After he succeeded with this
generous undertaking, Godefroid was admitted to the Brotherhood. [The
Seamy Side of History.]

GODENARS (Abbe de), born about 1795; one of the vicars-general of the
archbishop of Besancon between 1830 and 1840. From 1835 on he tried to
get a bishopric. One evening he was present at the aristocratic salon
of the Wattevilles, at the time of the sudden flight of Albert
Savarus, caused by their young daughter. [Albert Savarus.]

GODESCHAL (Francois-Claude-Marie), born about 1804. In 1818, at Paris,
he was third clerk in the law office of Derville, rue Vivienne, when
the unfortunate Chabert appeared upon the scene. [Colonel Chabert.] In
1820, then an orphan and poor, he and his sister, the dancer Mariette,
to whom he was devoted, lived on an eighth floor on rue Vielle-du-
Temple. He had already given evidence of a practical temperament,
independent and self-seeking, but upright and capable of generous
outbursts. [A Bachelor's Establishment.] In 1822, having risen to
second clerk, he left Maitre Derville to become head-clerk in
Desroches' office, who was greatly pleased with him. Godeschal even
undertook to reform Oscar Husson. [A Start in Life.] Six years later,
while still Desroches' head-clerk, he drew up a petition wherein Mme.
d'Espard prayed a guardian for her husband. [The Commission in
Lunacy.] Under Louis Philippe he became one of the advocates of Paris
and paid half his fees--1840--proposing to pay the other half with the
dowry of Celeste Colleville, whose hand was refused him, despite the
recommendation of Cardot the notary. Was engaged for Peyrade, in the
purchase of a house near the Madeleine. [The Middle Classes.] About
1845 Godeschal was still practicing, and numbered among his clients
the Camusots de Marville. [Cousin Pons.]

GODESCHAL (Marie), born about 1804. She maintained, almost all her
life, the nearest and most tender relations with her brother Godeschal
the notary. Without relatives or means, she kept house with him in
1820, on the eighth floor of a house on rue Vielle-du-Temple, Paris.
Ambition and love for her brother caused her to become a dancer. She
had studied her profession from her tenth year. The famous Vestris
instructed her and predicted great things for her. Under the name of
Mariette, she was engaged at the Porte-Saint-Martin and the Royal
Academy of Music. Her success displeased the famous Begrand. In
January, 1821, her angelic beauty, maintained despite her profession,
opened to her the doors of the Opera. Then she had lovers. The
aristocratic and elegant Maufrigneuse protected her for several years.
Mariette also favored Philippe Bridau and was the innocent cause of a
theft committed by him in order to enable him to contend with
Maufrigneuse. Four months later she went to London, where she won the
rich members of the House of Lords, and returned as premiere to the
Academy of Music. She was intimate with Florentine Cabirolle, who
often received in the Marais. There it was that Mariette kept Oscar
Husson out of serious trouble. Mariette attended many festivities. And
at the close of the reign of Louis Philippe, she was still a leading
figure in the Opera. [A Bachelor's Establishment. A Start in Life.
Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. Cousin Pons.]

GODIN, under Louis Philippe, a Parisian bourgeois engaged in a lively
dispute with a friend of La Palferine's. [A Prince of Bohemia.]

GODIN (La), peasant woman of Conches, Burgundy, about 1823, whose cow
Vermichel threatened to seize for the Comte de Montcornet. [The
Peasantry.]

GODIVET, recorder of registry of Arcis-sur-Aube in 1839. Through the
scheming of Pigoult he was chosen as one of two agents for an
electoral meeting called by Simon Giguet, one of the candidates, and
presided over by Phileas Beauvisage. [The Member for Arcis.]

GODOLLO (Comtesse Torna de), probably a Hungarian; police spy
reporting to Corentin. Was ordered to prevent the marriage of Theodose
de la Peyrade and Celeste Colleville. To accomplish this she went to
live in the Thuilliers' house, Paris, in 1840, cultivated them and
finally ruled them. She sometimes assumed the name of Mme. Komorn. Her
wit and beauty exercised a passing effect upon Peyrade. [The Middle
Classes.]

GOGUELAT, infantryman of the first Empire, entered the Guard in 1812;
was decorated by Napoleon on the battlefield of Valontina; returned
during the Restoration to the village of Isere, of which Benassis was
mayor, and became postman. [The Country Doctor.]

GOHIER, goldsmith to the King of France in 1824; supplied Elisabeth
Baudoyer with the monstrance with which she decorated the church of
Saint Paul, in order to bring about Isidore Baudoyer's promotion in
office. [The Government Clerks.]

GOMEZ, captain of the "Saint Ferdinand," a Spanish brig which in 1833
conveyed the newly-enriched Marquis d'Aiglemont from America to
France. Gomez was boarded by a Columbian corsair whose captain, the
Parisian, ordered him cast overboard. [A Woman of Thirty.]

GONDRAND (Abbe), confessor, under the Restoration, at Paris, of the
Duchesse Antoinette de Langeais, whose excellent dinners and petty
sins he dealt with at his ease in her salon where Montriveau often
found him. [The Thirteen.]

GONDREVILLE (Malin, his real name; more frequently known as the Comte
de), born in 1763, probably at Arcis-sur-Aube. Short and stout;
grandson of a mason employed by Marquis de Simeuse in the building of
the Gondreville chateau; only son of the owner of a house at Arcis
where dwelt his friend Grevin in 1839. On the recommendation of
Danton, he entered the office of the attorney at the chatelet, Paris,
in 1787. Head clerk for Maitre Bordin in the same city, the same year.
Returned to the country two years later to become a lawyer at Troyes.
Became an obscure and cowardly member of the Convention. Acquired the
friendship of Talleyrand and Fouche, in June, 1800, under singular and
opportune circumstances. Successively and rapidly became tribune,
councillor of state, count of the Empire--created Comte de Gondreville
--and finally senator. As councillor of state, Gondreville devoted his
attention to the preparation of the code. He cut a dash at Paris. He
had purchased one of the finest mansions in Faubourg Saint-Germain and
married the only daughter of Sibuelle, a wealthy contractor of "shady"
character whom Gondreville made co-receiver of Aube, with Marion. The
marriage was celebrated during the Directory or the Consulate. Three
children were the result of this union: Charles de Gondreville,
Marechale de Carigliano, Mme. Francois Keller. In his own interest,
Malin attached himself to Bonaparte. Later, in the presence of the
Emperor and of Dubois, the prefect of police, Gondreville selfishly
simulated a false generosity and asked that the Hauteserres and
Simeuses be striken from the list of the proscribed. Afterwards they
were falsely accused of kidnapping him. As senator in 1809, Malin gave
a grand ball at Paris, when he vainly awaited the Emperor's
appearance, and when Mme. de Lansac reconciled the Soulanges family.
Louis XVIII. made him a peer of France. His wide experience and
ownership of many secrets aided Gondreville, whose counsels hindered
Decazes and helped Villele. Charles X. disliked him because he
remained too intimate with Talleyrand. Under Louis Philippe this bond
was relaxed. The July monarchy heaped honors upon him by making him
peer once more. One evening in 1833 he met at the home of the
Princesse de Cadignan, Henri de Marsay, the prime minister, who had an
inexhaustible fund of political stories, new to all the company save
Gondreville. He was much engrossed with the elections of 1839, and
gave his influence to his grandson, Charles Keller, for Arcis. He
concerned himself little with the candidates, who were finally
elected; Dorlange-Sallenauve, Phileas Beauvisage, Trailles and Giguet.
[The Gondreville Mystery. A Start in Life. Domestic Peace. The Member
for Arcis.]

GONDREVILLE (Comtesse Malin de), born Sibuelle; wife of foregoing;
person whose complete insignificance was manifest at the great ball
given in Paris by the count in 1809. [Domestic Peace.]

GONDREVILLE (Charles de), son of the preceding, and sub-lieutenant of
dragoons in 1818. Young and wealthy, he died in the Spanish campaign
of 1823. His death caused great sorrow to his mistress, Mme.
Colleville. [The Middle Classes.]

GONDRIN, born in 1774, in the department of Isere. Conscripted in 1792
and put in the artillery. Was in the Italian and Egyptian campaigns
under Bonaparte, as a private, and returned east after the Peace of
Amiens. Enrolled, during the Empire, in the pontoon corps of the
Guard, he marched through Germany and Russia; was in the battle at
Beresina aiding to build the bridge by which the remnant of the army
escaped; with forty-one comrades, received the praise of General Eble
who singled him out particularly. Returned to Wilna, as the only
survivor of the corps after the death of Eble and in the beginning of
the Restoration. Unable to read or write, deaf and decrepit, Gondrin
forlornly left Paris which had treated him inhospitably, and returned
to the village in Dauphine, where the mayor, Dr. Benassis, gave him
work as a ditcher and continued to aid him in 1829. [The Country
Doctor.]

GONDRIN (Abbe), young Parisian priest about the middle of the reign of
Louis Philippe. Exquisite and eloquent. Knew the Thuilliers. [The
Middle Classes.]

GONDUREAU, assumed name of Bibi-Lupin.

GONORE (La), widow of Moses the Jew, chief of the southern /rouleurs/,
in May, 1830; mistress of Dannepont the thief and assassin; ran a
house of ill-repute on rue Sainte-Barbe for Mme. Nourrisson. [Scenes
from a Courtesan's Life.]

GORDES (Mademoiselle de), at the head of an aristocratic salon of
Alencon, about 1816, while her father, the aged Marquis de Gordes, was
still living with her. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

GORENFLOT, mason of Vendome, who walled up the closet concealing Mme.
de Merret's lover, the Spaniard Bagos de Feredia. [La Grande
Breteche.]

GORENFLOT, probably posed for Quasimodo of Hugo's "Notre-Dame."
Decrepit, misshapen, deaf, diminutive, he lived in Paris about 1839,
and was organ-blower and bell-ringer in the church of Saint-Louis en
l'Ile. He also acted as messenger in the confidential financial

GORIOT,* (Jean-Joachim), born about 1750; started as a porter in the
grain market. During the first Revolution, although he had received no
education, but having a trader's instinct, he began the manufacture of
vermicelli and made a fortune out of it. Thrift and fortune favored
him under the Terror. He passed for a bold citizen and fierce patriot.
Prosperity enabled him to marry from choice the only daughter of a
wealthy farmer of Brie, who died young and adored. Upon their two
children, Anastasie and Delphine, he lavished all the tenderness of
which their mother had been the recipient, spoiling them with fine
things. Goriot's griefs date from the day he set each up in
housekeeping in magnificent fashion on Chaussee-d'Antin. Far from
being grateful for his pecuniary sacrifices, his sons-in-law, Restaud
and Nucingen, and his daughters themselves, were ashamed of his
bourgeois exterior. In 1813 he had retired saddened and impoverished
to the Vauquer boarding-house on rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. The
quarrels of his daughters and the greedy demands for money increased
and in 1819 followed him thither. Almost all the guests of the house
and especially Mme. Vauquer herself--whose ambitious designs upon him
had come to naught--united in persecuting Goriot, now well-nigh
poverty-stricken. He found an agreeable respite when he acted as a go-
between for the illicit love affair of Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac,
his fellow-lodger. The financial distress of Mme. de Restaud,
Trailles' victim, gave Goriot the finishing blow. He was compelled to
give up the final and most precious bit of his silver plate, and beg
the assistance of Gobseck the usurer. He was crushed. A serious attack
of apoplexy carried him off. He died on rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve.
Rastignac watched over him, and Bianchon, then an interne, attended
him. Only two men, Christophe, Mme. Vauquer's servant, and Rastignac,
followed the remains to Saint-Etienne du Mont and to Pere-Lachaise.
The empty carriages of his daughters followed as far as the cemetery.
[Father Goriot.]

*   Two Parisian theatres and five authors have depicted Goriot's life
    on the stage; March 6, 1835, at the Vaudeville, Ancelot and Paul
    Dupont; the same year, the month following, at the Varietes,
    Theaulon, Alexis de Comberousse and Jaime Pere. Also the /Boeuf
    Gras/ of a carnival in a succeeding year bore the name of Goriot.

GORITZA (Princesse), a charming Hungarian, celebrated for her beauty,
towards the end of Louis XV.'s reign, and to whom the youthful
Chevalier de Valois became so attached that he came near fighting on
her account with M. de Lauzun; nor could he ever speak of her without
emotion. From 1816 to 1830, the Alencon aristocracy were given
glimpses of the princess's portrait, which adorned the chevalier's
gold snuff-box. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

GORJU (Madame), wife of the mayor of Sancerre, in 1836, and mother of
a daughter "whose figure threatened to change with her first child,"
and who sometimes came with her to the receptions of Mme. de la
Baudraye, the "Muse of the Department." One evening, in the fall of
1836, she heard Lousteau reading ironically fragments of "Olympia."
[The Muse of the Department.]

GOTHARD, born in 1788; lived about 1803 in Arcis-sur-Aube, where his
courage and address obtained for him the place of groom to Laurence de
Cinq-Cygne. Devoted servant of the countess; he was one of the
principals acquitted in the trial which ended with the execution of
Michu. [The Gondreville Mystery.] Gothard never left the service of
the Cinq-Cygne family. Thirty-six years later he was their steward.
With his brother-in-law, Poupard, the Arcis tavern-keeper, he
electioneered for his masters. [The Member for Arcis.]

GOUJET (Abbe), cure of Cinq-Cygne, Aube, about 1792, discovered for
the son of Beauvisage the farmer, who were still good Catholics, the
Greek name of Phileas, one of the few saints not abolished by the new
regime. [The Member for Arcis.] Former abbe of the Minimes, and a
friend of Hauteserre. Was the tutor of Adrien and Robert Hauteserre;
enjoyed a game of boston with their parents--1803. His political
prudence sometimes led him to censure the audacity of their kinswoman,
Mlle. de Cinq-Cygne. Nevertheless, he held his own with the persecutor
of the house, Corentin the police-agent; and attended Michu when that
victim of a remarkable trial, known as "the abduction of Gondreville,"
went to the scaffold. During the Restoration he became Bishop of
Troyes. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

GOUJET (Mademoiselle), sister of the foregoing; good-natured old maid,
ugly and parsimonious, who lived with her brother. Almost every
evening she played boston at the Hauteserres and was terrified by
Corentin's visits. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

GOULARD, mayor of Cinq-Cygne, Aube, in 1803. Tall, stout and miserly;
married a wealthy tradeswoman of Troyes, whose property, augmented by
all the lands of the rich abbey of Valdes-Preux, adjoined Cinq-Cygne.
Goulard lived in the old abbey, which was very near the chateau of
Cinq-Cygne. Despite his revolutionary proclivities, he closed his eyes
to the actions of the Hauteserres and Simeuses who were Royalist
plotters. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

GOULARD (Antonin), native of Arcis, like Simon Giguet. Born about
1807; son of the former huntsman of the Simeuse family, enriched by
the purchase of public lands. (See preceding biography.) Early left
motherless, he came to Arcis to live with his father, who abandoned
the abbey of Valpreux. Went to the Imperial lyceum, where he had Simon
Giguet for school-mate, whom he afterwards met again on the benches of
the Law school at Paris. Obtained, through Gondreville, the Cross of
the Legion of Honor. The royal government of 1830 opened up for him a
career in the public service. In 1839 he became sub-prefect for Arcis-
sur-Aube, during the electoral period. The delegate, Trailles,
satisfied Antonin's rancor against Giguet: his official
recommendations caused the latter's defeat. Both the would-be prefect
and the sub-prefect vainly sought the hand of Cecile Beauvisage.
Goulard cultivated the society of officialdom: Marest, Vinet,
Martener, Michu. [The Member for Arcis.]

GOUNOD, nephew of Vatel, keeper of the Montcornet estate at Aigues,
Burgundy. About 1823 he probably became assistant to the head-keeper,
Michaud. [The Peasantry.]

GOUPIL (Jean-Sebastien-Marie), born in 1802; a sort of humpless
hunchback; son of a well-to-do farmer. After running through with his
inheritance, in Paris, he became head-clerk of the notary Cremiere-
Dionis, of Nemours--1829. On account of Francois Minoret-Levrault, he
annoyed in many ways, even anonymously, Ursule Mirouet, after the
death of Dr. Minoret. Afterwards he repented his actions, repaid their
instigator, and succeeded the notary, Cremiere-Dionis. Thanks to his
wit, he became honorable, straightforward and completely transformed.
Once established, Goupil married Mlle. Massin, eldest daughter of
Massin-Levrault junior, clerk to the justice of the peace at Nemours.
She was homely, had a dowry of 80,000 francs, and gave him rickety,
dropsical children. Goupil took part in the "three glorious days" and
had obtained a July decoration. He was very proud of the ribbon.
[Ursule Mirouet.]

GOURAUD (General, Baron), born in 1782, probably at Provins. Under the
Empire he commanded the Second regiment of hussars, which gave him his
rank. The Restoration caused his impoverished years at Provins. He
mixed in politics and the opposition there, sought the hand and above
all the dowry of Sylvie Rogron, persecuted the apparent heiress of the
old maid, Mlle. Pierrette Lorrain--1827--and, seconded by Vinet the
attorney, reaped in July, 1830, the fruits of his cunning liberalism.
Thanks to Vinet, the ambitious parvenu, Gouraud married, in spite of
his gray hair and stout frame, a girl of twenty-five, Mlle. Matifat,
of the well-known drug-firm of rue des Lombards, who brought with her
fifty thousand crowns. Titles, offices and emoluments now flowed in
rapidly. He resumed the service, became general, commanded a division
near the capital and obtained a peerage. His conduct during the
ministry of Casimir Perier was thus rewarded. Futhermore he received
the grand ribbon of the Legion of Honor, after having stormed the
barricades of Saint-Merri, and was "delighted to thrash the bourgeois
who had been an eye-sore to him" for fifteen years. [Pierrette.] About
1845 he had stock in Gaudissart's theatre. [Cousin Pons.]

GOURDON, the elder, husband of the only daugher of the old head-
keeper of streams and forests, Gendrin-Wattebled; was in 1823
physician at Soulanges and attended Michaud. Nevertheless he went
among the best people of Soulanges, headed by Mme. Soudry, who
regarded him in the light of an unknown and neglected savant, when he
was but a parrot of Buffon and Cuvier, a simple collector and
taxidermist. [The Peasantry.]

GOURDON, the younger, brother of the preceding; wrote the poem of "La
Bilboqueide" published by Bournier. Married the niece and only heiress
of Abbe Tupin, cure of Soulanges, where he himself had been in 1823
clerk for Sarcus. He was wealthier than the justice. Mme. Soudry and
her set gave admiring welcome to the poet, preferring him to
Lamartine, with whose works they slowly became acquainted. [The
Peasantry.]

GOUSSARD (Laurent) was a member of the revolutionary municipality of
Arcis-sur-Aube. Particular friend of Danton, he made use of the
tribune's influence to save the head of the ex-superior of the
Ursulines at Arcis, Mother Marie des Anges, whose gratitude for his
generous and skillful action caused substantial enrichment to this
purchaser of the grounds of the convent, which was sold as "public
land." Thus it was that forty years afterwards this adroit Liberal
owned several mills on the river Aube, and was still at the head of
the advanced Left in that district. The various candidates for deputy
in the spring of 1839, Keller, Giguet, Beauvisage, Dorlange-
Sallenauve, and the government agent, Trailles, treated Goussard with
the consideration he deserved. [The Member for Arcis.]

GRADOS had in his hands the notes of Vergniaud the herder. By means of
funds from Derville the lawyer, Grados was paid in 1818 by Colonel
Chabert. [Colonel Chabert.]

GRAFF (Johann), brother of a tailor established in Paris under Louis
Philippe. Came himself to Paris after having been head-waiter in the
hotel of Gedeon Brunner at Frankfort; and ran the Hotel du Rhin in rue
du Mail where Frederic Brunner and Wilhelm Schwab alighted penniless
in 1835. The landlord obtained small positions for the two young men;
for the former with Keller; for the latter with his brother the
tailor. [Cousin Pons.]

GRAFF (Wolfgang), brother of the foregoing, and rich tailor of Paris,
at whose shop in 1838 Lisbeth Fischer fitted out Wenceslas Steinbock.
On his brother's recommendation, he employed Wilhelm Schwab, and, six
years later, took him into the family by giving him Emilie Graff in
marriage. [Cousin Betty. Cousin Pons.]

GRANCEY (Abbe de), born in 1764. Took orders because of a
disapointment in love; became priest in 1786, and cure in 1788. A
distinguished prelate who refused three bishoprics in order not to
leave Besancon. In 1834 he became vicar-general of that diocese. The
abbe had a handsome head. He gave free vent to cutting speeches. Was
acquainted with Albert Savarus whom he liked and aided. A frequenter
of the Watteville salon he found out and rebuked Rosalie, the singular
and determined enemy of the advocate. He also intervened between
Madame and Mademoiselle de Watteville. He died at the end of the
winter of 1836-37. [Albert Savarus.]

GRANCOUR (Abbe de), one of the vicars-general of the bishopric of
Limoges, about the end of the Restoration; and the physical antithesis
of the other vicar, the attenuated and moody Abbe Dutheil whose lofty
and independent liberal doctrines he, with cowardly caution, secretly
shared. Grancour frequented the Graslin salon and doubtless knew of
the Tascheron tragedy. [The Country Parson.]

GRANDEMAIN was in 1822 at Paris clerk for Desroches. [A Start in
Life.]

GRANDET (Felix), of Saumur, born between 1745 and 1749. Well-to-do
master-cooper, passably educated. In the first years of the Republic
he married the daughter of a rich lumber merchant, by whom he had in
1796 one child, Eugenie. With their united capital, he bought at a
bargain the best vineyards about Saumur, in addition to an old abbey
and several farms. Under the Consulate he became successively member
of the district government and mayor of Saumur. But the Empire, which
supposed him to be a Jacobin, retired him from the latter office,
although he was the town's largest tax-payer. Under the Restoration
the despotism of his extraordinary avarice disturbed the peace of his
family. His younger brother, Guillaume, failed and killed himself,
leaving in Felix's hands the settlement of his affairs, and sending to
him his son Charles, who had hastened to Saumur, not knowing his
father's ruin. Eugenie loved her cousin and combated her father's
niggardliness, which looked after his own interests to the neglect of
his brother. The struggle between Eugenie and her father broke Mme.
Grandet's heart. The phases of the terrible duel were violent and
numerous. Felix Grandet's passion resorted to stratagem and stubborn
force. Death alone could settle with this domestic tyrant. In 1827, an
octogenarian and worth seventeen millions, he was carried off by a
stroke of paralysis. [Eugenie Grandet.]

GRANDET (Madame Felix), wife of the preceding; born about 1770;
daughter of a rich lumber merchant, M. de la Gaudiniere; married in
the beginning of the Republic, and gave birth to one child, Eugenie,
in 1796. In 1806 she added considerably to the combined wealth of the
family through two large inheritances--from her mother and M. de la
Bertelliere, her maternal grandfather. A devout, shrinking,
insignificant creature, bowed beneath the domestic yoke, Mme. Grandet
never left Saumur, where she died in October, 1822, of lung trouble,
aggravated by grief at her daughter's rebellion and her husband's
severity. [Eugenie Grandet.]

GRANDET (Victor-Ange-Guillaume), younger brother of Felix Grandet;
became rich at Paris in wine-dealing. In 1815 before the battle of
Waterloo, Frederic de Nucingen bought of him one hundred and fifty
thousand bottles of champagne at thirty sous, and sold them at six
francs; the allies drank them during the invasion--1817-19. [The Firm
of Nucingen.] The beginning of the Restoration favored Guillaume. He
was the husband of a charming woman, the natural daughter of a great
lord, who died young after giving him a child. Was colonel of the
National Guard, judge of the Court of Commerce, governor of one of the
arrondissements of Paris and deputy. Saumur accused him of aspiring
still higher and wishing to become the father-in-law of a petty
duchess of the imperial court. The bankruptcy of Maitre Roguin was the
partial cause of the ruin of Guillaume, who blew out his brains to
avoid disgrace, in November, 1819. In his last requests, Guillaume
implored his elder brother to care for Charles whom the suicide had
rendered doubly an orphan. [Eugenie Grandet.]

GRANDET, (Charles), only lawful child of the foregoing; nephew of
Felix Grandet; born in 1797. He led at first the gay life of a young
gallant, and maintained relations with a certain Annette, a married
woman of good society. The tragic death of his father in November,
1819, astounded him and led him to Saumur. He thought himself in love
with his cousin Eugenie to whom he swore fidelity. Shortly thereafter
he left for India, where he took the name of Carl Sepherd to escape
the consequences of treasonable actions. He returned to France in 1827
enormously wealthy, debarked at Bordeaux in June of that year,
accompanying the Aubrions whose daughter Mathilde he married, and
allowed Eugenie Grandet to complete the settlement with the creditors
of his father. [Eugenie Grandet.] By his marriage he became Comte
d'Aubrion. [The Firm of Nucingen.]

GRANDET (Eugenie).* (See Bonfons, Eugenie Cruchot de.)

*   The incidents of her life have been dramatized by Bayard for the
    Gymnase-Dramatique, under the title of "The Miser's Daughter."

GRANDLIEU (Comtesse de), related to the Herouvilles; lived in the
first part of the seventeenth century; probably ancestress of the
Grandlieus, well known in France two centuries later. [The Hated Son.]

GRANDLIEU (Mademoiselle), under the first Empire married an imperial
chamberlain, perhaps also the prefect of Orne, and was received,
alone, in Alencon among the exclusive and aristocratic set lorded over
by the Esgrignons. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

GRANDLIEU (Duc Ferdinand de), born about 1773; may have descended from
the Comtesse de Grandlieu who lived early in the seventeenth century,
and consequently connected with the old and worthy nobility of the
Duchy of Brittany whose device was "Caveo non timeo." At the end of
the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuries,
Ferdinand de Grandlieu was the head of the elder branch, wealthy and
ducal, of the house of Grandlieu. Under the Consulate and the Empire
his high and assured rank enabled him to intercede with Talleyrand in
behalf of M. d'Hauteserre and M. de Simeuse, compromised in the
fictitious abduction of Malin de Gondreville. Grandlieu by his
marriage with an Ajuda of the elder branch, connected with the
Barganzas and of Portuguese descent, had several daughters, the eldest
of whom assumed the veil in 1822. His other daughters were Clotilde-
Frederique, born in 1802; Josephine the third; Sabine born in 1809;
Marie-Athenais, born about 1820. An uncle by marriage of Mme. de
Langeais, he had at Paris, in Faubourg Saint-Germain, a hotel where,
during the reign of Louis XVIII., the Princesse de Blamont-Chauvry,
the Vidame de Pamiers and the Duc de Navarreins assembled to consider
a startling escapade of Antoinette de Langeais. At least ten years
later Grandlieu availed himself of his intimate friend Henri de
Chaulieu and also of Corentin--Saint-Denis--in order to stay the suit
against Lucien de Rubempre which was about to compromise his daughter
Clotilde-Frederique. [The Gondreville Mystery. The Thirteen. A
Bachelor's Establishment. Modeste Mignon. Scenes from a Courtesan's
Life.]

GRANDLIEU (Duchesse Ferdinand de), of Portuguese descent, born Ajuda
and of the elder branch of that house connected with the Braganzas.
Wife of Ferdinand de Grandlieu, and mother of several daughters. Of
sedentary habits, proud, pious, good-hearted and beautiful, she
wielded in Paris during the Restoration a sort of supremacy over the
Faubourg Saint-Germain. The second and the next to the youngest of her
children gave her much anxiety. Combating the hostility of those about
her she welcomed Rubempre, the suitor of her daughter Clotilde-
Frederique--1829-30. The unfortunate results of the marriage of her
other daughter Sabine, Baronne Calyste du Guenic, occupied Mme. de
Grandlieu's attention in 1837, and she succeeded in reconciling the
young couple, with the assistance of Abbe Brossette, Maxime de
Trailles, and La Palferine. Her religious scruples had made her halt a
moment; but they fell like her political fidelity, and, with Mmes.
d'Espard, de Listomere and des Touches, she tacitly recognized the
bourgeois royalty, a few years after a new reign began, and re-opened
the doors of her salon. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. Beatrix. A
Daughter of Eve.]

GRANDLIEU (Mademoiselle de), eldest daughter of the Duc and Duchesse
de Grandlieu, took the veil in 1822. [A Bachelor's Establishment.
Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

GRANDLIEU (Clotilde-Frederique de), born in 1802; second daughter of
the Duc and Duchesse de Grandlieu; a long, flat creature, the
caricature of her mother. She had no consent save that of her mother
when she fell in love with and wished to marry the ambitious Lucien de
Rubempre in the spring of 1830. She saw him for the last time on the
road to Italy in the forest of Fontainbleu near Bouron and under very
painful circumstances the young man was arrested before her very eyes.
[Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

GRANDLIEU (Josephine de). (See Ajuda-Pinto, Marquise Miguel d'.)

GRANDLIEU (Sabine de). (See Guenic, Baronne Calyste du.)

GRANDLIEU (Marie-Athenais de). (See Grandlieu, Vicomtesse Juste de.)

GRANDLIEU (Vicomtesse de), sister of Comte de Born; descended more
directly than the duke from the countess of the seventeenth century.
From 1813, the time of her husband's death, the head of the younger
Grandlieu house whose device was "Grands faits, grand lieu." Mother of
Camille and of Juste de Grandlieu, and the mother-in-law of Ernest de
Restaud. Returned to France with Louis XVIII. At first she lived on
royal bounty, but afterwards regained a considerable portion of her
property through the efforts of Maitre Derville, about the beginning
of the Restoration. She was very grateful to the lawyer, who also took
her part against the Legion of Honor, was admitted to her confidential
circle and told her the secrets of the Restaud household, one evening
in the winter of 1830 when Ernest de Restaud, son of the Comtesse
Anastasie, was paying court to Camille whom he finally married.
[Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. Colonel Chabert. Gobseck.]

GRANDLIEU (Camille de). (see Restaud, Comtesse Ernest de.)

GRANDLIEU (Vicomte Juste de), son of Vicomtesse de Grandlieu; brother
of Comtesse Ernest de Restaud; cousin and afterwards husband of Marie-
Athenais de Grandlieu, combining by this marriage the fortunes of the
two houses of Grandlieu and obtaining the title of duke. [Scenes from
a Courtesan's Life. Gobseck.]

GRANDLIEU (Vicomtesse Juste de), born about 1820, Marie-Athenais de
Grandlieu; last daughter of Duc and Duchesse de Grandlieu; married to
her cousin, the Vicomte Juste de Grandlieu. She received at Paris in
the first days of the July government, a young married woman like
herself, Mme. Felix de Vandenesse, then in the midst of a flirtation
with Raoul Nathan. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. Gobseck. A
Daughter of Eve.]

GRANET, deputy-mayor of the second arrondissement of Paris, in 1818,
under La Billardiere. With his homely wife he was invited to the
Birotteau ball. [Cesar Birotteau.]

GRANET, one of the leading men of Besancon, under Louis Philippe. In
gratitude for a favor done him by Albert Savarus he nominated the
latter for deputy. [Albert Savarus.]

GRANSON (Madame), poor widow of a lieutenant-colonel of artillery
killed at Jena, by whom she had a son, Athanase. From 1816 she lived
at No. 8 rue du Bercail in Alencon, where the benevolence of a distant
relative, Mme. du Bousquier, put in her charge the treasury of a
maternal society against infanticide, and brought her into contact,
under peculiar circumstances, with the woman who afterwards became
Mme. Theodore Gaillard. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

GRANSON (Athanase), son of the preceding; born in 1793; subordinate in
the mayor's office at Alencon in charge of registry. A sort of poet,
liberal in politics and filled with ambition; weary of poverty and
overflowing with grandiose sentiments. In 1816 he loved, with a
passion that his commonsense combated, Mme. du Bousquier, then Mlle.
Cormon, his senior by more than seventeen years. In 1816 the marriage
dreaded by him took place. He could not brook the blow and drowned
himself in the Sarthe. He was mourned only by his mother and Suzanne
du Val-Noble. [Jealousies of a Country Town.] Nevertheless, eight
years after it was said of him: "The Athanase Gransons must die,
withered up, like the grains which fall on barren rock." [The
Government Clerks.]

GRANVILLE (Comte de), had a defective civil status, the orthography of
the name varying frequently through the insertion of the letter "d"
between the "n" and "v." In 1805 at an advanced age he lived at
Bayeux, where he was probably born. His father was a president of the
Norman Parliament. At Bayeux the Comte married his son to the wealthy
Angelique Bontems. [A Second Home.]

GRANVILLE (Vicomte de), son of Comte de Granville, and comte upon his
father's death; born about 1779; a magistrate through family
tradition. Under the guidance of Cambaceres he passed through all the
administrative and judicial grades. He studied with Maitre Bordin,
defended Michu in the trial resulting from the "Gondreville Mystery,"
and learned officially and officiously of one of its results a short
time after his marriage with a young girl of Bayeux, a rich heiress
and the acquirer of extensive public lands. Paris was generally the
theatre for the brilliant career of Maitre Granville who, during the
Empire, left the Augustin quai where he had lived to take up his abode
with his wife on the ground-floor of a mansion in the Marais, between
rue Vielle-du-Temple and rue Nueve-Saint-Francois. He became
successively advocate-general at the court of the Seine, and president
of one of its chambers. At this time a domestic drama was being
enacted in his life. Hampered in his open and broad-minded nature by
the bigotry of Mme. de Granville, he sought domestic happiness outside
his home, though he already had a family of four children. He had met
Caroline Crochard on rue du Tourniquet-Saint-Jean. He installed her on
rue Taitbout and found in this relation, though it was of brief
duration, the happiness vainly sought in his proper home. Granville
screened this fleeting joy under the name of Roger. A daughter
Eugenie, and a son Charles, were born of this adulterous union which
was ended by the desertion of Mlle. Crochard and the misconduct of
Charles. Until the death of Mme. Crochard, the mother of Caroline,
Granville was able to keep up appearances before his wife. Thus it
happened that he accompanied her to the country, Seine-et-Oise, when
he assisted M. d'Albon and M. de Sucy. The remainder of Granville's
life, after his wife and his mistress left him, was passed in
comparative solitude in the society of intimate friends like Octave de
Bauvan and Serizy. Hard work and honors partially consoled him. His
request as attorney-general caused the reinstatement of Cesar
Birotteau, one of the tenants at No. 397 rue Saint-Honore. He and his
wife had been invited to the famous ball given by Birotteau more than
three years previously. As attorney-general of the Court of Cassation,
Granville secretly protected Rubempre during the poet's famous trial,
thus drawing upon himself the powerful affection of Jacques Collin,
counterbalanced by the enmity of Amelie Camusot. The Revolution of
July upheld Granville's high rank. He was peer of France under the new
regime, owning and occupying a small mansion on rue Saint-Lazare, or
traveling in Italy. At this time he was one of Dr. Bianchon's
patients. [The Gondreville Mystery. A Second Home. Farewell. Cesar
Birotteau. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. A Daughter of Eve. Cousin
Pons.]

GRANVILLE (Comtesse Angelique de), wife of preceding, and daughter of
Bontems, a farmer and sort of Jacobin whom the Revolution enriched
through the purchase of evacuated property at low prices. She was born
at Bayeux in 1787, and received from her mother a very bigoted
education. At the beginning of the Empire she married the son of one
of the neighbors of the family, then Vicomte and later Comte de
Granville; and, under the influence of Abbe Fontanon, she maintained
at Paris the manners and customs of an extreme devotee. She thus
evoked the infidelity of her husband who had begun by simply
neglecting her. Of her four children she retained charge of the
education of her two daughters. She broke off entirely from her
husband when she discovered the existence of her rival, Mlle. de
Bellefeuille--Caroline Crochard--and returned to Bayeux to end her
days, remaining to the last the austere, stingy sanctified creature
who had formerly been scandalized by the openness of the affair of
Montriveau and Mme. de Langeais. She died in 1822. [A Second Home. The
Thirteen. A Daughter of Eve.]

GRANVILLE (Vicomte de), elder son of the preceding. Was reared by his
father. In 1828 he was deputy-attorney at Limoges, where he afterwards
became advocate-general. He fell in love with Veronique Graslin, but
incurred her secret disfavor by his proceedings against the assassin
Tascheron. The vicomte had a career almost identical with that of his
father. In 1833 he was made first president at Orleans, and in 1844
attorney-general. Later near Limoges he came suddenly upon a scene
which moved him deeply: the public confession of Veronique Graslin.
The vicomte had unknowingly been the executioner of the chatelaine of
Montegnac. [A Second Home. A Daughter of Eve. The Country Parson.]

GRANVILLE (Baron Eugene de), younger brother of the foregoing. King's
attorney at Paris from May, 1830. Three years later he still held this
office, when he informed his father of the arrest of a thief named
Charles Crochard, who was the count's natural son. [Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life. A Second Home.]

GRANVILLE (Marie-Angelique de). (See Vandenesse, Comtesse Felix de.)

GRANVILLE (Marie-Eugenie de). (See Tillet, Madame Ferdinand du.)

GRASLIN (Pierre), born in 1775. An Auvergnat, compatriot and friend of
Sauviat, whose daughter Veronique he married in 1822. He began as a
bank-clerk with Grosstete & Perret, a first-class firm of the town. A
man of business and a hard worker he became successor to his
employers. His fortune, increased by lucky speculations with Brezac,
enabled him to buy one of the finest places in the chief city of
Haute-Vienne. But he was not able to win his wife's heart. His
physical unattractiveness, added to by his carelessness and grinding
avarice, were complicated by a domestic tyranny which soon showed
itself. Thus it was that he was only the legal father of a son named
Francis, but he was ignorant of this fact, for, in the capacity of
juror in the Court of Assizes dealing with the fate of Tascheron, the
real father of the child, he urged but in vain the acquittal of the
prisoner. Two years after the boy's birth and the execution of the
mother's lover, in April, 1831, Pierre Graslin died of weakness and
grief. The July Revolution suddenly breaking forth had shaken his
financial standing, which was regained only with an effort. It was at
the time when he had brought Montegnac from the Navarreins. [The
Country Parson.]

GRASLIN (Madame Pierre), wife of preceding; born Veronique Sauviat, at
Limoges in May, 1802; beautiful in spite of traces of small-pox; had
had the spoiled though simple childhood of an only daughter. When
twenty she married Pierre Graslin. Soon after marriage her ingenuous
nature, romantic and refined, suffered in secret from the harsh
tyranny of the man whose name she bore. Veronique, however, held aloof
from the gallants who frequented her salon, especially the Vicomte de
Granville. She had become the secret mistress of J.-F. Tascheron, a
porcelain worker. She was on the point of eloping with him when a
crime committed by him was discovered. Mme. Graslin suffered the most
poignant anguish, giving birth to the child of the condemned man at
the very moment when the father was led to execution. She inflicted
upon herself the bitterest flagellations. She could devote herself
more freely to penance after her husband's death, which occurred two
years later. She left Limoges for Montegnac, where she made herself
truly famous by charitable works on a huge scale. The sudden return of
the sister of her lover dealt her the final blow. Still she had energy
enough to bring about the union of Denise Tascheron and Gregoire
Gerard, gave her son into their keeping, left important bequests
destined to keep alive her memory, and died during the summer of 1844
after confessing in public in the presence of Bianchon, Dutheil,
Granville, Mme. Sauviat and Bonnet who were all seized with admiration
and tenderness for her. [The Country Parson.]

GRASLIN (Francis), born at Limoges in August, 1829. Only child of
Veronique Graslin, legal son of Pierre Graslin, but natural son of J.-
F. Tascheron. He lost his legal father two years after his birth, and
his mother thirteen years later. His tutor M. Ruffin, his maternal
grandmother Mme. Sauviat, and above all the Gregoire Gerards watched
over his boyhood at Montegnac. [The Country Parson.]

GRASSET, bailiff and successor of Louchard. On the demand of Lisbeth
Fischer and by Rivet's advice, in 1838, he arrested W. Steinbock in
Paris and took him to Clichy prison. [Cousin Betty.]

GRASSINS (Des), ex-quartermaster of the Guard, seriously wounded at
Austerlitz, pensioned and decorated. Time of Louis XVIII. he became
the richest banker in Saumur, which he left for Paris where he located
with the purpose of settling the unfortunate affairs of the suicide,
Guillaume Grandet and where he was later made a deputy. Although the
father of a family he conceived a passion for Florine, a pretty
actress of the Theatre du Madame,* to the havoc of his fortune.
[Eugenie Grandet.]

*   The name of this theatre was changed, in 1830, to Gymnase-
    Dramatique.

GRASSINS (Madame des), born about 1780; wife of foregoing, giving him
two children; spent most of her life at Saumur. Her husband's position
and sundry physical charms which she was able to preserve till nearly
her fortieth year enabled her to shine somewhat in society. With the
Cruchots she often visited the Grandets, and, like the family of the
President de Bonfons, she dreamed of mating Eugenie with her son
Adolphe. The dissipated life of her husband at Paris and the
combination of the Cruchots upset her plans. Nor was she able to do
much for her daughter. However, deprived of much of her property and
making the best of things, Mme. des Grassins continued unaided the
management of the bank at Saumur. [Eugenie Grandet.]

GRASSINS (Adolphe des), born in 1797, son of M. and Mme. des Grassins;
studied law at Paris where he lived in a lavish way. A caller at the
Nucingens where he met Charles Grandet. Returned to Saumur in 1819 and
vainly courted Eugenie Grandet. Finally he returned to Paris and
rejoined his father whose wild life he imitated. [Eugenie Grandet.]

GRASSOU (Pierre), born at Fougeres, Brittany, in 1795. Son of a
Vendean peasant and militant Royalist. Removing at an early age to
Paris he began as clerk to a paint-dealer who was from Mayenne and a
distant relative of the Orgemonts. A mistaken idea led him toward art.
His Breton stubbornness led him successively to the studios of Servin,
Schinner and Sommervieux. He afterwards studied, but fruitlessly, the
works of Granet and Drolling; then he completed his art studies with
Duval-Lecamus. Grassou profited nothing by his work with these
masters, nor did his acquaintance with Lora or Joseph Bridau assist
him. Though he could understand and admire he lacked the creative
faculty and the skill in execution. For this reason Grassou, usually
called Fougeres by his comrades, obtained their warm support and
succeeded in getting admission into the Salon of 1829, for his "Toilet
of a Condemned Chouan," a very mediocre painting palpably along the
lines of Gerard Dow. The work obtained for him from Charles X. the
cross of the Legion of Honor. At last his canvasses found purchasers.
Elie Magus gave him an order for pictures after the Flemish school,
which he sold to Vervelle as works of Dow or Teniers. At that time
Grassou lived at No. 2 rue de Navarin. He became the son-in-law of
Vervelle, in 1832, marrying Virginie Vervelle, the heiress of the
family, who brought him a dowry of one hundred thousand francs, as
well as country and city property. His determined mediocrity opened
the doors of the Academy to him and made him an officer in the Legion
of Honor in 1830, and major of a battalion in the National Guard after
the riots of May 12. He was adored by the middle classes, becoming
their accredited artist. Painted portraits of all the members of the
Crevel and Thuillier families, and also of the director of the theatre
who preceded Gaudissart. Left many frightful and ridiculous daubs, one
of which found its way into Topinard's humble home. [Pierre Grassou. A
Bachelor's Establishment. Cousin Betty. The Middle Classes. Cousin
Pons.]

GRASSOU (Madame Pierre), born Virginie Vervelle; red-haired and
homely; sole heiress of wealthy dealers in cork, on rue Boucherat.
Wife of the preceding whom she married in Paris in 1832. There is a
portrait of her painted in this same year before her marriage, which
at first was a colorless study by Grassou, but was dexterously
retouched by Joseph Bridau. [Pierre Grassou.]

GRAVELOT brothers, lumber-merchants of Paris, who purchased in 1823
the forests of Aigues, the Burgundy estate of General de Montcornet.
[The Peasantry.]

GRAVIER, paymaster-general of the army during the first Empire, and
interested at that time in large Spanish affairs with certain
commanding officers. Upon the return of the Bourbons he purchased at
twenty thousand francs of La Baudraye the office of tax-receiver for
Sancerres, which office he still held about 1836. With the Abbe Duret
and others he frequented the home of Mme. Dinah de la Baudraye. He was
little, fat and common. His court made little way with the baroness,
despite his talent and his worldly-wise ways of a bachelor. He sang
ballads, told stories, and displayed pseudo-rare autographs. [The Muse
of the Department.]

GRAVIER, of Grenoble; head of a family; father-in-law of a notary;
chief of division of the prefecture of Isere in 1829. Knew Genestas
and recommended to him Dr. Benassis, the mayor of the village of which
he himself was one of the benefactors, as the one to attend Adrien
Genestas-Renard. [The Country Doctor.]

GRENIER, known as Fleur-de-Genet; deserter from the Sixty-ninth demi-
brigade; chauffeur executed in 1809. [The Seamy Side of History.]

GRENOUVILLE, proprietor of a large and splendid notion store in
Boulevard des Italiens, Paris, about 1840; a customer of the Bijous,
embroiderers also in business at Paris. At this time an ardent admirer
of Mlle. Olympe Bijou, former mistress of Baron Hulot and Idamore
Chardin. He married her and gave an income to her parents. [Cousin
Betty.]

GRENOUVILLE (Madame), wife of the preceding; born Olympe Bijou, about
1824. In the middle of the reign of Louis Philippe she lived in Paris
near La Courtille, in rue Saint-Maur-du-Temple. Was a pretty but poor
embroiderer surrounded by a numerous and poverty-stricken family when
Josepha Mirah obtained for her old Baron Hulot and a shop. Having
abandoned Hulot for Idamore Chardin, who left her, Olympe married
Grenouville and became a well-known tradeswoman. [Cousin Betty.]

GRENVILLE (Arthur-Ormond, Lord), wealthy Englishman; was being treated
at Montpellier for lung trouble when the rupture of the treaty of
peace of Amiens confined him to Tours. About 1814 he fell in love with
the Marquise Victor d'Aiglemont, whom he afterwards met elsewhere.
Posing as a physician he attended her in an illness and succeeded in
curing her. He visited her also in Paris, finally dying to save her
honor, after suffering his fingers to be crushed in a door--1823. [A
Woman of Thirty.]

GREVIN of Arcis, Aube, began life in the same way as his compatriot
and intimate friend Malin de Gondreville. In 1787, he was second clerk
to Maitre Bordin, attorney of the Chatelet, Paris. Returned to
Champagne at the outbreak of the Revolution. There he received the
successive protection of Danton, Bonaparte and Gondreville. By virtue
of them he became an oracle to the Liberals, was enabled to marry
Mlle. Varlet, the only daughter of the best physician of the city, to
purchase a notary's practice, and to become wealthy. A level-headed
man, Grevin often advised Gondreville, and he directed the mysterious
and fictitious abduction--1803 and the years following. Of his union
with Mlle. Varlet, who died rather young, one daughter was born,
Severine, who became Mme. Phileas Beauvisage. In his old age he
devoted a great deal of attention to his children and their brilliant
future, especially during the election of May, 1839. [A Start in Life.
The Gondreville Mystery. The Member for Arcis.]

GREVIN (Madame), wife of foregoing; born Varlet; daughter of the best
doctor of Arcis-sur-Aube; sister of another Varlet, a doctor in the
same town; mother of Mme. Severine Phileas Beauvisage. With Mme.
Marion she was more or less implicated in the Gondreville mystery. She
died rather young. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

GREVIN, corsair, who served under Admiral de Simeuse in the Indies. In
1816, paralyzed and deaf, he lived with his granddaughter, Mme.
Lardot, a laundress of Alencon, who employed Cesarine and Suzanne and
was patronized by the Chevalier de Valois. [Jealousies of a Country
Town.]

GRIBEAUCOURT (Mademoiselle de), old maid of Saumur and friend of the
Cruchots during the Restoration. [Eugenie Grandet.]

GRIFFITH (Miss), born in 1787; Scotch woman, daughter of a minister in
straitened circumstances; under the Restoration she was governess of
Louise de Chaulieu, whose love she won by reason of her kindliness and
penetration. [Letters of Two Brides.]

GRIGNAULT (Sophie). (See Nathan, Mme. Raoul.)

GRIMBERT, held, in 1819, at Ruffec, Charente, the office of the Royal
Couriers. At that time he received from Mlles. Laure and Agathe de
Rastignac, a considerable sum of money addressed to their brother
Eugene, at the Pension Vauquer, Paris. [Father Goriot.]

GRIMONT, born about 1786; a priest of some capability; cure of
Guerande, Brittany. In 1836, a constant visitor at the Guenics, he
exerted a tardily acquired influence over Felicite des Touches, whose
disappointments in love he fathomed and whom he determined to turn
towards a religious life. Her conversion gave Grimont the vicar-
generalship of the diocese of Nantes. [Beatrix.]

GRIMPEL, physician at Paris in the Pantheon quarter, time of Louis
XVIII. Among his patients was Mme. Vauquer, who sent for him to attend
Vautrin when the latter was overcome by a narcotic treacherously
administered by Mlle. Michonneau. [Father Goriot.]

GRINDOT, French architect in the first half of the nineteenth century;
won the Roman prize in 1814. His talent, which met the approval of the
Academy, was heartily recognized by the masses of Paris. About the end
of 1818 Cesar Birotteau gave him carte-blanche in the remodeling of
his apartments on rue Saint-Honore, and invited him to his ball.
Matifat, between the years 1821 and 1822, commissioned him to ornament
the suite of Mme. Raoul Nathan on rue de Bondy. The Comte de Serizy
employed him likewise in 1822 in the restoration of his chateau of
Presles near Beaumont-sur-Oise. About 1829 Grindot embellished a
little house on rue Saint-Georges where successively dwelt Suzanne
Gaillard and Esther van Gobseck. Time of Louis Philippe, Arthur de
Rochefide, and M. and Mme. Fabien du Ronceret gave him contracts. His
decline and that of the monarchy coincided. He was no longer in vogue
during the July government. On motion of Chaffaroux he received
twenty-five thousand francs for the decoration of four rooms of
Thuillier's. Lastly Crevel, an imitator and grinder, utilized Grindot
on rue des Saussaies, rue du Dauphin and rue Barbet-de-Jouy for his
official and secret habitations. [Cesar Birotteau. Lost Illusions. A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris. A Start in Life. Scenes from a
Courtesan's Life. Beatrix. The Middle Classes. Cousin Betty.]

GROISON, non-commissioned officer of cavalry in the Imperial Guard;
later, during the Restoraton, estate-keeper of Blangy, where he
succeeded Vaudoyer at a salary of three hundred francs. Montcornet,
mayor of that commune arranged a marriage between the old soldier and
the orphan daughter of one of his farmers who brought him three acres
of vineyards. [The Peasantry.]

GROS (Antoine-Jean), celebrated painter born in Paris in 1771, drowned
himself June, 1835. Was the teacher of Joseph Bridau and, despite his
parsimonious habits, supplied materials--about 1818--to the future
painter of "The Venetian Senator and the Courtesan" enabling him to
obtain five thousand francs from a double government position. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

GROSLIER, police commissioner of Arcis-sur-Aube at the beginning of
the electoral campaign of 1839. [The Member for Arcis.]

GROSMORT, small boy of Alencon in 1816. Left the town in that year and
went to Prebaudet, an estate of Mme. du Bousquier, to tell her of
Troisville's arrival. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

GROSS-NARP (Comte de), son-in-law, no doubt fictitious, of a very
great lady, invented and represented by Jacqueline Collin to serve the
menaced interests of Jacques Collin in Paris about the end of the
Restoration. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

GROSSTETE (F.), director, with Perret, of a Limoges banking-house,
during the Empire and Restoration. His clerk and successor was Pierre
Graslin. Retired from business, a married man, wealthy, devoted to
horticulture, he spent much of his time in the fields in the outskirts
of Limoges. Endowed with a superior intellect, he seemed to understand
Veronique Graslin, whose society he sought and whose secrets he tried
to fathom. He introduced his godson, Gregoire Gerard, to her. [The
Country Parson.]

GROSSTETE (Madame F.), wife of preceding; a person of some importance
in Limoges, time of the Restoration. [The Country Parson.]

GROSSTETE, younger brother of F. Grosstete. Receiver-general at
Bourges during the Restoration. He had a large fortune which enabled
his daughter Anna to wed a Fontaine about 1823. [The Country Parson.
The Muse of the Department.]

GROZIER (Abbe) was chosen, in the early part of the Restoration, to
arbitrate the dispute of two proof-readers--one of whom was Saint-
Simon--over Chinese paper. He proved that the Chinese make their paper
from bamboo. [Lost Illusions.] He was librarian of the Arsenal at
Paris. Was tutor of the Marquis d'Espard. Was learned in the history
and manners of China. Taught this knowledge to his pupil. [The
Commission in Lunacy.]*

*   Abbe Grozier, or Crozier (Jean Baptiste-Gabriel-Alexandre), born
    March 1, 1743, at Saint-Omer, died December 8, 1823, at Paris;
    collaborator of the "Literary Year" with Freron and Geoffroy, and
    author of a "General History of China"--Paris 1777-1784, 12 vols.

GRUGET (Madame Etienne), born in the latter part of the eighteenth
century. About 1820, lace-maker at No. 12 rue des Enfants-Rouges,
Paris, where she concealed and cared for Gratien Bourignard, the lover
of her daughter Ida, who drowned herself. Bourignard was the father of
Mme. Jules Desmarets. [The Thirteen.] Becoming a nurse about the end
of 1824, Mme. Gruget attended the division-chief, La Billiardiere, in
his final sickness. [The Government Clerks.] In 1828 she followed the
same profession for ten sous a day, including board. At that time she
attended the last illness of Comtesse Flore Philippe de Brambourg, on
rue Chaussee-d'Antin, before the invalid was removed to the Dubois
hospital. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

GRUGET (Ida), daughter of the preceding. About 1820 was a corset-
fitter at No. 14 rue de la Corderie-du-Temple, Paris; employed by Mme.
Meynardie. She was also the mistress of Gatien Bourignard.
Passionately jealous, she rashly made a scene in the home of Jules
Desmarets, her lover's son-in-law. Then she drowned herself, in a fit
of despair, and was buried in a little cemetery of a village of Seine-
et-Oise. [The Thirteen.]

GUA SAINT-CYR (Madame du), in spite of the improbability aroused on
account of her age, passed for a time, in 1799, as the mother of
Alphonse de Montauran. She had been married and was then a widow; Gua
was not her true name. She was the last mistress of Charette and,
being still young, took his place with the youthful Alphonse de
Montauran. She displayed a savage jealousy for Mlle. de Verneuil. One
of the first Vendean sallies of 1799, planned by Mme. du Gua, was
unsuccessful and absurd. The old "mare of Charette" caused the coach
between Mayenne and Fougeres to be waylaid; but the money stolen was
that which was being sent her by her mother. [The Chouans.]

GUA SAINT-CYR (Du), name assumed in Brittany, in 1799, by Alphonse de
Montauran, the Chouan leader. [The Chouans.]

GUA SAINT-CYR (Monsieur and Madame du), son and mother; rightful
bearers of the name were murdered, with the courier, in November by
the Chouans. [The Chouans.]

GUDIN (Abbe), born about 1759; was one of the Chouan leaders in 1799.
He was a formidable fellow, one of the Jesuits stubborn enough,
perhaps devoted enough, to oppose upon French soil the proscriptive
edict of 1793. This firebrand of Western conflict fell, slain by the
Blues, almost under the eyes of his patriot nephew, the sub-
lieutenant, Gudin. [The Chouans.]

GUDIN, nephew of the preceding, and nevertheless a patriot conscript
from Fougeres, Brittany, during the campaign of 1799; successively
corporal and sub-lieutenant. The former grade was obtained through
Hulot. Was the superior of Beau-Pied. Gudin was killed near Fougeres
by Marie de Verneuil, who had assumed the attire of her husband,
Alphonse de Montauran. [The Chouans.]

GUENEE (Madame). (See Galardon, Madame.)

GUENIC (Gaudebert-Calyste-Charles, Baron du), born in 1763. Head of a
Breton house of very ancient founding, he justified throughout his
long life the device upon his coat-of-arms, which read: "Fac!" Without
hope of reward he constantly defended, in Vendee and Brittany, his God
and his king by service as private soldier and captain, with Charette,
Chatelineau, La Rochejacquelein, Elbee, Bonchamp and the Prince of
Loudon. Was one of the commanders of the campaign of 1799 when he bore
the name of "L'Intime," and was, with Bauvan, a witness to the
marriage /in extremis/ of Alphonse de Montauran and Marie de Verneuil.
Three years later he went to Ireland, where he married Miss Fanny
O'Brien, of a noble family of that country. Events of 1814 permitted
his return to Guerande, Loire-Inferieure, where his house, though
impoverished, wielded great influence. In recognition of his
unfaltering devotion to the Royalist cause, M. du Guenic received only
the Cross of Saint-Louis. Incapable of protesting, he intrepidly
defended his town against the battalions of General Travot in the
following year. The final Chouan insurrection, that of 1832, called
him to arms once again. Accompanied by Calyste, his only son, and a
servant, Gasselin, he returned to Guerande, lived there for some
years, despite his numerous wounds, and died suddenly, at the age of
seventy-four, in 1837. [The Chouans. Beatrix.]

GUENIC (Baronne du), wife of the preceding; native of Ireland; born
Fanny O'Brien, about 1793, of aristocratic lineage. Poor and
surrounded by wealthy relatives, beautiful and distinguished, she
married, in 1813, Baron du Guenic, following him the succeeding year
to Guerande and devoting her life and youth to him. She bore one son,
Calyste, to whom she was more like an elder sister. She watched
closely the two mistresses of the young man, and finally understood
Felicite des Touches; but she always was in a tremor on account of
Beatrix de Rochefide, even after the marriage of Calyste, which took
place in the year of the baron's death. [Beatrix.]

GUENIC (Gaudebert-Calyste-Louis du), probably born in 1815, at
Guerande, Loire-Inferieure; only son of the foregoing, by whom he was
adored, and to whose dual influence he was subject. He was the
physical and moral replica of his mother. His father wished to make
him a gentleman of the old school. In 1832 he fought for the heir of
the Bourbons. He had other aspirations which he was able to satisfy at
the home of an illustrious chatelaine of the vicinity, Mlle. Felicite
des Touches. The chevalier was much enamored of the celebrated
authoress, who had great influence over him, did not accept him and
turned him over to Mme. de Rochefide. Beatrix played with the heir of
the house of Guenic the same ill-starred comedy carried through by
Antoinette de Langeais with regard to Montriveau. Calyste married
Mlle. Sabine de Grandlieu, and took the title of baron after his
father's death. He lived in Paris on Faubourg Saint-Germain, and
between 1838 and 1840 was acquainted with Georges de Maufrigneuse,
Savinien de Portenduere, the Rhetores, the Lenoncourt-Chaulieus and
Mme. de Rochefide--whose lover he finally became. The intervention of
the Duchesse de Grandlieu put an end to this love affair. [Beatrix.]

GUENIC (Madame Calyste du), born Sabine de Grandlieu; wife of the
preceding, whom she married about 1837. Nearly three years later she
was in danger of dying upon hearing, at her confinement, that she had
a fortunate rival in the person of Beatrix de Rochefide. [Beatrix.]

GUENIC (Zephirine du) born in 1756 at Guerande; lived almost all her
life with her younger brother, the Baron du Guenic, whose ideas,
principles and opinions she shared. She dreamed of a rehabilitation of
her improverished house, and pushed her economy to the point of
refusng to undergo an operation for cataract. For a long time she
wished that Mlle. Charlotte de Kergarouet might become her niece by
marriage. [Beatrix.]

GUEPIN, of Provins, located in Paris. He had at the "Trois
Quenouilles" one of the largest draper's shops on rue Saint-Denis. His
head-clerk was his compatriot, Jerome-Denis Rogron. In 1815, he turned
over his business to his grandson and returned to Provins, where his
family formed a clan. Later Rogron retired also and rejoined him
there. [Pierrette.]

GUERBET, wealthy farmer in the country near Ville-aux-Fayes; married,
in the last of the eighteenth or first of the nineteenth century, the
only daughter of Mouchon junior, then postmaster of Conches, Burgundy.
After the death of his father-in-law, about 1817, he succeeded to the
office. [The Peasantry.]

GUERBET, brother of the foregoing, and related to the Gaubertins and
Gendrins. Rich tax-collector of Soulanges, Burgundy. Stout, dumpy
fellow with a butter face, wig, earrings, and immense collars; given
to pomology; was the wit of the village and one of the lions of Mme.
Soudry's salon. [The Peasantry.]

GUERBET, circuit judge of Ville-aux-Fayes, Burgundy, in 1823. Like his
uncle, the postmaster, and his father, the tax-collector, he was
entirely devoted to Gaubertin. [The Peasantry.]

GUILLAUME, in the course of, or at the end of the eighteenth century,
began as clerk to Chevrel, draper, on rue Saint-Denis, Paris, "at the
Sign of the Cat and Racket"; afterwards became his son-in-law,
succeeded him, became wealthy and retired, during the first Empire,
after marrying off his two daughters, Virginie and Augustine, in the
same day. He became member of the Consultation Committee for the
uniforming of the troops, changed his home, living in a house of his
own on rue du Colombier, was intimate with the Ragons and the
Birotteaus, being invited with his wife to the ball given by the
latter. [At the Sign of the Cat and Racket. Cesar Birotteau.]

GUILLAUME (Madame), wife of the preceding; born Chevrel; cousin of
Mme. Roguin; a stiff-necked, middle-class woman, who was scandalized
by the marriage of her second daughter, Augustine, with Theodore de
Sommervieux. [At the Sign of the Cat and Racket.]

GUILLAUME, servant of Marquis d'Aiglemont in 1823. [A Woman of
Thirty.]

GUINARD (Abbe), priest of Sancerre in 1836. [The Muse of the
Department.]

GYAS (Marquise de), lived at Bordeaux during the Restoration; gave
much thought to marrying off her daughter, and, being intimate with
Mme. Evangelista, felt hurt when Natalie Evangelista married Paul de
Manerville in 1822. However, the Marquis de Gyas was one of the
witnesses at the wedding. [A Marriage Settlement.]



H

HABERT (Abbe), vicar at Provins under the Restoration; a stern,
ambitious prelate, a source of annoyance to Vinet; dreamed of marrying
his sister Celeste to Jerome-Denis Rogron. [Pierrette.]

HABERT (Celeste), sister of the preceding; born about 1797; managed a
girls' boarding-school at Provins, in the closing years of Charles
X.'s reign. Visited at the Rogrons. Gouraud and Vinet shunned her.
[Pierrette.]

HADOT (Madame), who lived at La Charite, Nievre, in 1836, was mistaken
for Mme. Barthelemy-Hadot, the French novelist, whose name was
mentioned at Mme. de la Baudraye's, near Sancerre. [The Muse of the
Department.]

HALGA (Chevalier du), naval officer greatly esteemed by Suffren and
Portenduere; captain of Kergarouet's flagship; lover of that admiral's
wife, whom he survived. He served in the Indian and Russian waters,
refused to take up arms against France, and returned with a petty
pension after the emigration. Knew Richelieu intimately. Remained in
Paris the inseparable friend and adherent of Kergarouet. Called near
the Madeleine upon the Mesdames de Rouville, other protegees of his
patron. The death of Louis XVIII. took Halga back to Guerande, his
native town, where he became mayor and was still living in 1836. He
was well acquainted with the Guenics and made himself ridiculous by
his fancied ailments as well as by his solicitude for his dog, Thisbe.
[The Purse. Beatrix.]

HALPERSOHN (Moses), a refugee Polish Jew, excellent physician,
communist, very eccentric, avaricious, friend of Lelewel the
insurrectionist. Time of Louis Philippe at Paris, he attended Vanda de
Mergi, given up by several doctors, and also diagnosed her complicated
disease. [The Seamy Side of History.]

HALPERTIUS, assumed name of Jacques Collin.

HANNEQUIN (Leopold), Parisian notary. The "Revue de l'Est," a paper
published at Besancon, time of Louis Philippe, gave, in an
autobiographical novel of its editor-in-chief, Albert Savarus,
entitled "L'Ambitieux par Amour," the story of the boyhood of Leopold
Hannequin, the author's inseparable friend. Savarus told of their
joint travels, and of the quiet preparation made by his friend for a
notaryship during the time known as the Restoration. During the
monarchy of the barricades Hannequin remained the steadfast friend of
Savarus, being one of the first to find his hiding-place. At that time
the notary had an office in Paris. He married there to advantage,
became head of a family, and deputy-mayor of a precinct, and obtained
the decoration for a wound received at the cloister of Saint-Merri. He
was welcomed and made use of in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the Saint-
Georges quarter and the Marais. At the Grandlieus' request he drew up
the marriage settlement of their daughter Sabine with Calyste du
Guenic--1837. Four years later he consulted with old Marshal Hulot, on
rue du Montparnasse, regarding his will in behalf of Mlle. Fischer and
Mme. Steinbock. About 1845, at the request of Heloise Brisetout, he
drew up Sylvain Pons' will. [Albert Savarus. Beatrix. Cousin Betty.
Cousin Pons.]

HAPPE & DUNCKER, celebrated bankers of Amsterdam, amateur art-
collectors, and snobbish parvenus, bought, in 1813, the fine gallery
of Balthazar Claes, paying one hundred thousand ducats for it. [The
Quest of the Absolute.]

HAUDRY, doctor at Paris during the first part of the nineteenth
century. An old man and an upholder of old treatments; having a
practice mainly among the middle class. Attended Cesar Birotteau,
Jules Desmarets, Mme. Descoings and Vanda de Mergi. His name was still
cited at the end of Louis Philippe's reign. [Cesar Birotteau. The

HAUGOULT (Pere), oratorian and regent of the Vendome college, about
1811. Stern and narrow-minded, he did not comprehend the budding
genius of one of his pupils, Louis Lambert, but destroyed the
"Treatise on the Will," written by the lad. [Louis Lambert.]

HAUTESERRE (D'), born in 1751; grandfather of Marquis de Cinq-Cygne;
guardian of Laurence de Cinq-Cygne; father of Robert and Adrien
d'Hauteserre. A gentleman of caution he would willingly have parleyed
with the Revolution; he made this evident after 1803 in the Arcis
precinct where he resided, and especially during the succeeding years
marked by an affair which jeopardized the lives of some of his family.
Gondreville, Peyrade, Corentin, Fouche and Napoleon were bugaboos to
d'Hauteserre. He outlived his sons. [The Gondreville Mystery. The
Member for Arcis.]

HAUTESERRE (Madame d'), wife of the preceding; born in 1763; mother of
Robert and Adrien; showed throughout her wearied, saddened frame the
marks of the old regime. Following Goujet's advice she countenanced
the deeds of Mlle. de Cinq-Cygne, the bold, dashing counter-
revolutionist of Arcis during 1803 and succeeding years. Mme.
Hauteserre survived her sons. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

HAUTESERRE (Robert d'), elder son of the foregoing. Brusque, recalling
the men of mediaeval times, despite his feeble constitution. A man of
honor, he followed the fortunes of his brother Adrien and his kinsmen
the Simeuses. Like them, he emigrated during the first Revolution, and
returned to the neighborhood of Arcis about 1803. Like them again he
became enamored of Mlle. de Cinq-Cygne. Wrongly accused of having
abducted the senator, Malin de Gondreville, and sentenced to ten
years' hard labor, he obtained the Emperor's pardon and was made sub-
lieutenant in the cavalry. He died as colonel at the storming of
Moskowa, September 7, 1812. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

HAUTESERRE (Adrien d'), second son of M. and Mme. d'Hauteserre; was of
different stamp from his older brother Robert, yet had many things in
common with the latter's career. He also was influenced by honor. He
also emigrated and, on his return, fell under the same sentence. He
also obtained Napoleon's pardon and a commission in the army, taking
Robert's place in the attack on Moskowa; and in recognition of his
severe wounds became brigadier-general after the battle of Dresden,
August 26, 27, 1813. The doors of the Chateau de Cinq-Cygne were
opened to admit the mutilated soldier, who married his mistress,
Laurence, though his affection was not requited. This marriage made
Adrien Marquis de Cinq-Cygne. During the Restoration he was made a
peer, promoted to lieutenant-general, and obtained the Cross of Saint-
Louis. He died in 1829, lamented by his wife, his parents and his
children. [The Gondreville Mystery.]

HAUTESERRE (Abbe d'), brother of M. d'Hauteserre; somewhat like his
young kinsman in disposition; made some ado over his noble birth; thus
it happened that he was killed, shot in the attack on the Hotel de
Cinq-Cygne by the people of Troyes, in 1792. [The Gondreville
Mystery.]

HAUTOY (Francis du), gentleman of Angouleme; was consul at Valence.
Lived in the chief city of Charente between 1821 and 1824; frequented
the Bargetons; was on the most intimate terms with the Senonches, and
was said to be the father of Francoise de la Haye, daughter of Mme. de
Senonches. Hautoy seemed slightly superior to his associates. [Lost
Illusions.]

HENRI, police-agent at Paris in 1840, given special assignments by
Corentin, and placed as servant successively at the Thuilliers, and
with Nepomucene Picot, with the duty of watching Theodose de la
Peyrade. [The Middle Classes.]

HERBELOT, notary of Arcis-sur-Aube during the electoral period of
spring, 1839; visited the Beauvisages, Marions and Mollots. [The
Member for Arcis.]

HERBELOT (Malvina), born in 1809; sister of the preceding, whose
curiosity she shared, when the Arcis elections were in progress. She
also called on the Beauvisages and the Mollots, and, despite her
thirty years, sought the society of the young women of these houses.
[The Member for Arcis.]

HERBOMEZ, of Mayenne, nick-named General Hardi; chauffeur implicated
in the Royalist uprising in which Henriette Bryond took part, during
the first Empire. Like Mme. de la Chanterie's daughter, Herbomez paid
with his head his share in the rebellion. His execution took place in
1809. [The Seamy Side of History.]

HERBOMEZ (D'), brother of the foregoing, but more fortunate, he ended
by becoming a count and receiver-general. [The Seamy Side of History.]

HEREDIA (Marie). (See Soria, Duchesse de.)

HERMANN, a Nuremberg merchant who commanded a free company enlisted
against the French, in October, 1799. Was arrested and thrown into a
prison of Andernach, where he had for fellow-prisoner, Prosper Magnan,
a young assistant surgeon, native of Beauvais, Oise. Hermann thus
learned the terrible secret of an unjust detention followed by an
execution equally unjust. Many years after, in Paris, he told the
story of the martyrdom of Magnan in the presence of F. Taillefer, the
unpunished author of the dual crime which had caused the imprisonment
and death of an innocent man. [The Red Inn.]

HERON, notary of Issoudun in the early part of the nineteenth century,
who was attorney for the Rougets, father and son. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

HEROUVILLE (Marechal d'), whose ancestors' names were inscribed in the
pages of French history, during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, replete with glory and dramatic mystery; was Duc de Nivron.
He was the last governor of Normandy, returned from exile with Louis
XVIII. in 1814, and died at an advanced age in 1819. [The Hated Son.
Modeste Mignon.]

HEROUVILLE (Duc d'), son of the preceding; born in 1796, at Vienna,
Austria, during the emigration, "fruit of the matrimonial autumn of
the last governor of Normandy"; descendant of a Comte d'Herouville, a
Norman free-lance who lived under Henri IV. and Louis XIII. He was
Marquis de Saint-Sever, Duc de Nivron, Comte de Bayeux, Vicomte
d'Essigny, grand equerry and peer of France, chevalier of the Order of
the Spur and of the Golden Fleece, and grandee of Spain. A more modest
origin, however, was ascribed to him by some. The founder of his house
was supposed to have been an usher at the court of Robert of Normandy.
But the coat-of-arms bore the device "Herus Villa"--House of the
Chief. At any rate, the physical unattractiveness and comparative lack
of means of D'Herouville, who was a kind of dwarf, contrasted with his
aristocratic lineage. However, his income allowed him to keep a house
on rue Saint-Thomas du Louvre, Paris, and to keep on good terms with
the Chaulieus. He maintained Fanny Beaupre, who apparently cost him
dear; for, about 1829, he sought the hand of the Mignon heiress.
During the reign of Louis Philippe, D'Herouville, then a social
leader, had acquaintance with the Hulots, was known as a celebrated
art amateur, and resided on rue de Varenne, in Faubourg Saint-Germain.
Later he took Josepha Mirah from Hulot, and installed her in fine
style on rue Saint-Maur-du-Temple with Olympe Bijou. [The Hated Son.
Jealousies of a Country Town. Modeste Mignon. Cousin Betty.]

HEROUVILLE (Mademoiselle d'), aunt of the preceding; dreamed of a rich
marriage for that stunted creature, who seemed a sort of reproduction
of an evil Herouville of past ages. She desired Modeste Mignon for
him; but her aristocratic pride revolted at the thought of Mlle.
Monegod or Augusta de Nucingen. [Modeste Mignon.]

HEROUVILLE (Helene d'), niece of the preceding; sister of Duc
d'Herouville; accompanied her relatives to Havre in 1829; afterwards
knew the Mignons. [Modeste Mignon.]

HERRERA (Carlos), unacknowledged son of the Duc d'Ossuna; canon of the
cathedral of Toledo, charged with a political mission to France by
Ferdinand VII. He was drawn into an ambush by Jacques Collin, who
killed him, stripped him and then assumed his name until about 1830.
[Lost Illusions. Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

HICLAR, Parisian musician, in 1845, who received from Dubourdieu, a
symbolical painter, author of a figure of Harmony, an order to compose
a symphony suitable of being played before the picture. [The
Unconscious Humorists.]

HILEY, alias the Laborer, a chauffeur and the most cunning of minor
participants in the Royalist uprising of Orne. Was executed in 1809.
[The Seamy Side of History.]

HIPPOLYTE, young officer, aide-de-camp to general Eble in the Russian
campaign; friend of Major Philippe de Sucy. Killed in an attack on the
Russians near Studzianka, November 18, 1812. [Farewell.]

HOCHON, born at Issoudun about 1738; was tax-receiver at Selles,
Berry. Married Maximilienne, the sister of Sub-Delegate Lousteau. Had
three children, one of whom became Mme. Borniche. Hochon's marriage
and the change of the political horizon brought him back to his native
town where he and his family were long known as the Five Hochons.
Mlle. Hochon's marriage and the death of her brothers made the jest
still tenable; for M. Hochon, despite a proverbial avarice, adopted
their posterity--Francois Hochon, Baruch and Adolphine Borniche.
Hochon lived till an advanced age. He was still living at the end of
the Restoration, and gave shrewd advice to the Bridaus regarding the
Rouget legacy. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

HOCHON (Madame), wife of the preceding, born Maximilienne Lousteau
about 1750; sister of the sub-delegate; also god-mother of Mme.
Bridau, nee Rouget. During her whole life she displayed a sweet and
resigned sympathy. The neglected and timorous mother of a family, she
bore the matrimonial yoke of a second Felix Grandet. [A Bachelor's
Establishment.]

HOCHON, elder son of the foregoing; survived his brother and sister;
married at an early age to a wealthy woman by whom he had one son;
died a year before her, in 1813, slain at the battle of Hanau. [A
Bachelor's Establishment.]

HOCHON (Francois), son of the preceding, born in 1798. Left an orphan
at sixteen he was adopted by his paternal grandparents and lived in
Issoudun with his cousins, the Borniche children. He affiliated
secretly with Maxence Gilet, being one of the "Knights of Idlesse,"
till his conduct was discovered. His stern grandmother sent the young
man to Poitiers where he studied law and received a yearly allowance
of six hundred francs. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

HONORINE, (See Bauvan, Comtesse Octave de.)

HOPWOOD (Lady Julia), English; made a journey to Spain between 1818
and 1819, and had there for a time a chamber-maid known as Caroline,
who was none other than Antoinette de Langeais, who had fled from
Paris after Montriveau jilted her. [The Thirteen.]

HOREAU (Jacques), alias the Stuart, had been lieutenant in the Sixty-
ninth demi-brigade. Became one of the associates of Tinteniac, known
through his participation in the Quiberon expedition. Turned chauffeur
and compromised himself in the Orne Royalist uprising. Was executed in
1809. [The Seamy Side of History.]

HORTENSE was, under Louis Philippe, one of the numerous mistresses of
Lord Dudley. She lived on rue Tronchet when Cerizet employed Antonia
Chocardelle to hoodwink Maxime de Trailles. [A Man of Business. The
Member for Arcis.]

HOSTAL (Maurice de l'), born in 1802; living physical portrait of
Byron; nephew and like an adopted son of Abbe Loraux. He became, at
Marais, in rue Payenne, the secretary and afterwards the confidant of
Octave de Bauvan. Was acquainted with Honorine de Bauvan on rue Saint-
Maur-Popincourt and all but fell in love with her. Turned diplomat,
left France, married the Italian, Onorina Pedrotti, and became head of
a family. While consul to Genoa, about 1836, he again met Octave de
Bauvan, then a widower and near his end, who entrusted his son to him.
M. de l'Hostal once entertained Claude Vignon, Leon de Lora and
Felicite des Touches, to whom he related the marital troubles of the
Bauvans. [Honorine.]

HOSTAL (Madame Maurice de l'), wife of the preceding, born Onorina
Pedrotti. A beautiful and unusually rich Genoese; slightly jealous of
the consul; perhaps overhead the story of the Bauvans. [Honorine.]

HULOT, born in 1766, served under the first Republic and Empire. Took
an active part in the wars and tragedies of the time. Commanded the
Seventy-second demi-brigade, called the Mayencaise, during the Chouan
uprising of 1799. Fought against Montauran. His career as private and
officer had been so filled that his thirty-three years seemed an age.
He went out a great deal. Rubbed elbows with Montcornet; called on
Mme. de la Baudraye. He remained a democrat during the Empire;
nevertheless Bonaparte recognized him. Hulot was made colonel of the
grenadiers of the Guard, Comte de Forzheim and marshal. Retired to his
splendid home on rue du Montparnasse, where he passed his declining
years simply, being deaf, remaining a friend of Cottin de Wissembourg,
and often surrounded by the family of a brother whose misconduct
hastened his end in 1841. Hulot was given a superb funeral. [The
Chouans. The Muse of the Department. Cousin Betty.]

HULOT D'ERVY (Baron Hector), born about 1775; brother of the
preceding; took the name of Hulot d'Ervy early in life in order to
make a distinction between himself and his brother to whom he owed the
brilliant beginning of a civil and military career. Hulot d'Ervy
became ordonnance commissary during the Republic. The Empire made him
a baron. During one of these periods he married Adeline Fischer, by
whom he had two children. The succeeding governments, at least that of
July, also favored Hector Hulot, and he became in turn, intendant-
general, director of the War Department, councillor of state, and
grand officer of the Legion of Honor. His private misbehavior dated
from these periods and gathered force while he lived in Paris. Each of
his successive mistresses--Jenny Cadine, Josepha Mirah, Valerie
Marneffe, Olympe Bijou, Elodie Chardin, Atala Judici, Agathe Piquetard
--precipitated his dishonor and ruin. He hid under various names, as
Thoul, Thorec and Vyder, anagrams of Hulot, Hector and d'Ervy. Neither
the persecutions of the money-lender Samanon nor the influence of his
family could reform him. After his wife's death he married, February
1, 1846, Agathe Piquetard, his kitchen-girl and the lowest of his
servants. [Cousin Betty.]

HULOT D'ERVY (Baronne Hector), wife of the preceding; born Adeline
Fischer, about 1790, in the village of Vosges; remarkable for her
beauty; was married for mutual love, despite her inferior birth, and
for some time lived caressed and adored by her husband and venerated
by her brother-in-law. At the end of the Empire probably commenced her
sorrows and the faithlessness of Hector, notwithstanding the two
children born of their union, Victorin and Hortense. Had it not been
for her maternal solicitude the baroness could have condoned the
gradual degradation of her husband. The honor of the name and the
future of her daughter gave her concern. No sacrifice was too great
for her. She vainly offered herself to Celestin Crevel, whom she had
formerly scorned, and underwent the parvenu's insults; she besought
Josepha Mirah's aid, and rescued the baron from Atala Judici. The
closing years of her life were not quite so miserable. She devoted
herself to charitable offices, and lived on rue Louis-le-Grand with
her married children and their reclaimed father. The intervention of
Victorin, and the deaths of the Comte de Forzheim, of Lisbeth Fischer
and of M. and Mme. Crevel, induced comfort and security that was often
menaced. But the conduct of Hector with Agathe Piquetard broke the
thread of Mme. Hulot d'Ervy's life; for some time she had had a
nervous trouble. She died aged about fifty-six. [Cousin Betty.]

HULOT (Victorin), elder child of the foregoing. Married Mlle.
Celestine Crevel and was father of a family. Became under Louis
Philippe one of the leading attorneys of Paris. Was deputy, counsel of
the War Department, consulting counsel of the police service and
counsel for the civil list. His salary for the various offices came to
eighteen thousand francs. He was seated at Palais-Bourbon when the
election of Dorlange-Sallenauve was contested. His connection with the
police enabled him to save his family from the clutches of Mme.
Valerie Crevel. In 1834 he owned a house on rue Louis-le-Grand. Seven
or eight years later he sheltered nearly all the Hulots and their near
kindred, but he could not prevent the second marriage of his father.
[The Member for Arcis. Cousin Betty.]

HULOT (Madame Victorin), wife of preceding, born Celestine Crevel;
married as a result of a meeting between her father and her father-in-
law, who were both libertines. She took part in the dissensions
between the two families, replaced Lisbeth Fischer in the care of the
house on rue Louis-le-Grand, and probably never saw the second Mme.
Celestin Crevel, unless at the death-bed of the retired perfumer.
[Cousin Betty.]

HULOT (Hortense). (See Steinbock, Comtesse Wenceslas.)

HULOT D'ERVY (Baronne Hector), nee Agathe Piquetard of Isigny, where
she became the second wife of Hector Hulot d'Ervy. Went to Paris as
kitchen-maid for Hulot about December, 1845, and was married to her
master, then a widower, on February 1, 1846. [Cousin Betty.]

HUMANN, celebrated Parisian tailor of 1836 and succeeding years. At
the instance of the students Rabourdin and Juste he clothed the
poverty-stricken Zephirin Marcas "as a politician." [Z. Marcas.]

HUSSON (Madame.) (See Mme. Clapart.)

HUSSON (Oscar), born about 1804, son of the preceding and of M. Husson
--army-contractor; led a checkered career, explained by his origin and
childhood. He scarcely knew his father, who made and soon lost a
fortune. The previous fast life of his mother, who afterwards married
again, gave rise to or upheld some more or less influential
connections and made her, during the first Empire, the titular /femme
de chambre/ to Madame Mere--Letitia Bonaparte. Napoleon's fall marked
the ruin of the Hussons. Oscar and his mother--now married to M.
Clapart--lived in a modest apartment on rue de la Cerisaie, Paris.
Oscar obtained a license and became clerk in Desroches' law office in
Paris, being coached by Godeschal. During this time he became
acquainted with two young men, his cousins the Marests. One of them
had previously instigated an early escapade of Oscar's, and it was now
followed by one much more serious, on rue de Vendome at the house of
Florentine Cabirolle, who was then maintained by Cardot, Oscar's
wealthy uncle. Husson was forced to abandon law and enter military
service. He was in the cavalry regiment of the Duc de Maufrigneuse and
the Vicomte de Serizy. The interest of the dauphiness and of Abbe
Gaudron obtained for him promotion and a decoration. He became in turn
aide-de-camp to La Fayette, captain, officer of the Legion of Honor
and lieutenant-colonel. A noteworthy deed made him famous on Algerian
territory during the affair of La Macta; Husson lost his left arm in
the vain attempt to save Vicomte de Serizy. Put on half-pay, he
obtained the post of collector for Beaumont-sur-Oise. He then married
--1838--Georgette Pierrotin and met again the accomplices or witnesses
of his earlier escapades--one of the Marests, the Moreaus, etc. [A
Start in Life.]

HUSSON (Madame Oscar), wife of the preceding; born Georgette
Pierrotin; daughter of the proprietor of the stage-service of Oise. [A
Start in Life.]

HYDE DE NEUVILLE (Jean-Guillaume, Baron)--1776-1857--belonged to the
Martignac ministry of 1828; was, in 1797, one of the most active
Bourbon agents. Kept civil war aflame in the West, and held a
conference in 1799 with First Consul Bonaparte relative to the
restoration of Louis XVIII. [The Chouans.]



I

IDAMORE, nick-name of Chardin junior while he was /claqueur/ in a
theatre on the Boulevard du Temple, Paris. [Cousin Betty.]

ISEMBERG (Marechal, Duc d'), probably belonged to the Imperial
nobility. He lost at the gaming table, in November, 1809, in a grand
fete given at Paris at Senator Malin de Gondreville's home, while the
Duchesse de Lansac was acting as peacemaker between a youthful married
couple. [Domestic Peace.]



J

JACMIN (Philoxene), of Honfleur; perhaps cousin of Jean Butscha; maid
to Eleonore de Chaulieu; in love with Germain Bonnet, valet of
Melchior de Canalis. [Modeste Mignon.]

JACOMETY, head jailer of the Conciergerie, at Paris, in May, 1830,
during Rubempre's imprisonment. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life.]

JACQUELIN, born in Normandy about 1776; in 1816 was employed by Mlle.
Cormon, an old maid of Alencon. He married when she espoused M. du
Bousquier. After the double marriage Jacquelin remained for some time
in the service of the niece of the Abbe de Sponde. [Jealousies of a
Country Town.]

JACQUES, for a considerable period butler of Claire de Beauseant,
following her to Bayeux. Essentially "aristocratic, intelligent and
discreet," he understood the sufferings of his mistress. [Father
Goriot. The Deserted Woman.]

JACQUET (Claude-Joseph), a worthy bourgeois of the Restoration; head
of a family, and something of a crank. He performed the duties of a
deputy-mayor in Paris, and also had charge of the archives in the
Department of Foreign Affairs. Was greatly indebted to his friend
Jules Desmarets; so he deciphered for him, about 1820, a code letter
of Gratien Bourignard. When Clemence Desmarets died, Jacquet comforted
the broker in the Saint-Roch church and in the Pere-Lachaise cemetery.
[The Thirteen.]

JACQUINOT, said to have succeeded Cardot as notary at Paris, time of
Louis Philippe [The Middle Classes.]; but since Cardot was succeeded
by Berthier, his son-in-law, a discrepancy is apparent.

JACQUOTTE, left the service of a cure for that of Dr. Benassis, whose
house she managed with a devotion and care not unmixed with despotism.
[The Country Doctor.]

JAN,* a painter who cared not a fig for glory. About 1838 he covered
with flowers and decorated the door of a bed-chamber in a suite owned
by Crevel on rue du Dauphin, Paris. [Cousin Betty.]

*   Perhaps the fresco-painter, Laurent-Jan, author of "Unrepentant
    Misanthropy," and the friend of Balzac, to whom the latter
    dedicated his drama, "Vautrin."

JANVIER, priest in a village of Isere in 1829, a "veritable Fenelon
shrunk to a cure's proportions"; knew, understood and assisted
Benassis. [The Country Doctor.]

JAPHET (Baron), celebrated chemist who subjected to hydrofluoric acid,
to chloride of nitrogen, and to the action of the voltaic battery the
mysterious "magic skin" of Raphael de Valentin. To his stupefaction
the savant wrought no change on the tissue. [The Magic Skin.]

JEAN, coachman and trusted servant of M. de Merret, at Vendome, in
1816. [La Grande Breteche.]

JEAN, landscape gardener and farm-hand for Felix Grandet, enagaged
about November, 1819, in a field on the bank of the Loire, filling
holes left by removed populars and planting other trees. [Eugenie
Grandet.]

JEAN, one of the keepers of Pere-Lachaise cemetery in 1820-21;
conducted Desmarets and Jacquet to the tomb of Clemence Bourignard,
who had recently been interred.* [The Thirteen.]

*   In 1868, at Paris, MM. Ferdinand Dugue and Peaucellier presented a
    play at the Gaite theatre, where one of the chief characters was
    Clemence Bourignard-Desmarets.

JEAN, lay brother of an abbey until 1791, when he found a home with
Niseron, cure of Blangy, Burgundy; seldom left Gregoire Rigou, whose
factotum he finally became. [The Peasantry.]

JEANNETTE, born in 1758; cook for Ragon at Paris in 1818, in rue du
Petit-Lion-Saint-Sulpice; distinguished herself at the Sunday
receptions. [Cesar Birotteau.]

JEANRENAUD (Madame), a Protestant, widow of a salt bargeman, by whom
she had a son. A stout, ugly and vulgar woman, who recovered, during
the Restoration, a fortune that had been stolen by the Catholic
ancestors of D'Espard and was restored to him despite a suit to
restrain him by injunction. Mme. Jeanrenaud lived at Villeparisis, and
then at Paris, where she dwelt successively on rue de la Vrilliere--
No. 8--and on Grand rue Verte. [The Commission in Lunacy.]

JEANRENAUD, son of the preceding, born about 1792. He served as
officer in the Imperial Guard, and, through the influence of D'Espard-
Negrepelisse, became, in 1828, chief of squadron in the First regiment
of the Cuirassiers of the Guard. Charles X. made him a baron. He then
married a niece of Monegod. His beautiful villa on Lake Geneva is
mentioned by Albert Savarus in "L'Ambitieux par Amour," published in
the reign of Louis Philippe. [The Commission in Lunacy. Albert
Savarus.]

JENNY was, during the Restoration, maid and confidante of Aquilina de
la Garde; afterwards, but for a very brief time, mistress of
Castanier. [Melmoth Reconciled.]

JEROME (Pere), second-hand book-seller on Pont Notre-Dame, Paris, in
1821, at the time when Rubempre was making a start there. [A
Distinguished Provincial at Paris.]

JEROME, valet successively of Galard and of Albert Savarus at
Besancon. He may have served the Parisian lawyer less sedulously
because of Mariette, a servant at the Wattevilles, whose dowry he was
after. [Albert Savarus.]

JOHNSON (Samuel), assumed name of the police-agent, Peyrade.

JOLIVARD, clerk of registry, rue de Normandie, Paris, about the end of
Louis Philippe's reign. He lived on the first floor of the house owned
by Pillerault, attended by the Cibots and tenanted by the Chapoulots,
Pons and Schmucke. [Cousin Pons.]

JONATHAS, valet of M. de Valentin senior; foster-father of Raphael de
Valentin, whose steward he afterwards became when the young man was a
multi-millionaire. He served him faithfully and survived him. [The
Magic Skin.]

JORDY (De) had been successively captain in a regiment of Royal-
Suedois and professor in the Ecole Militaire. He had a refined nature
and a tender heart; was the type of a poor but uncomplaining
gentleman. His soul must have been the scene of sad secrets. Certain
signs led one to believe that he had had children whom he had adored
and lost. M. de Jordy lived modestly and quietly at Nemours. A
similiarity of tastes and character drew him towards Denis Minoret
whose intimate friend he became, and at whose home he conceived a
liking for the doctor's young ward--Mme. Savinien de Portenduere. He
had great influence over her, and left her an income of fourteen
hundred francs when he died in 1823. [Ursule Mirouet.]

JOSEPH, with Charles and Francois, was of the establishment of
Montcornet at Aigues, Burgundy, about 1823. [The Peasantry.]

JOSEPH, faithful servant of Rastignac at Paris, under the Restoration.
In 1828 he carried to the Marquise de Listomere a letter written by
his master to Mme. de Nucingen. This error, for which Joseph could
hardly be held responsible, caused the scorn of the marquise when she
discoverd that the missive was intended for another. [The Magic Skin.
A Study of Woman.]

JOSEPH, in the service of F. du Tillet, Paris, when his master was
fairly launched in society and received Birotteau in state. [Cesar
Birotteau.]

JOSEPH, given name of a worthy chimney-builder of rue Saint-Lazare,
Paris, about the end of the reign of Louis Philippe. Of Italian
origin, the head of a family, saved from ruin by Adeline Hulot, who
acted for Mme. de la Chanterie. Joseph was in touch with the scribe,
Vyder, and when he took Mme. Hulot to see the latter she recognized in
him her husband. [Cousin Betty.]

JOSEPHA, (See Mirah, Josepha.)

JOSETTE, cook for Claes at Douai; greatly attached to Josephine,
Marguerite and Felicie Claes. Died about the end of the Restoration.
[The Quest of the Absolute.]

JOSETTE, old housekeeper for Maitre Mathias of Bordeaux during the
Restoration. She accompanied her master when he bade farewell to Paul
de Manerville the emigrant. [A Marriage Settlement.]

JOSETTE, in and previous to 1816 chambermaid of Victoire-Rose Cormon
of Alencon. She married Jacquelin when her mistress married du
Bousquier. [Jealousies of a Country Town.]

JUDICI (Atala), born about 1829, of Lombard descent; had a paternal
grandfather, who was a wealthy chimney-builder of Paris during the
first Empire, an employer of Joseph; he died in 1819. Mlle. Judici did
not inherit her grandfather's fortune, for it was run through with by
her father. In 1844 she was given by her mother--so the story goes--to
Hector Hulot for fifteen thousand francs. She then left her family,
who lived on rue de Charonne, and lived on Passage du Soleil. The
pretty Atala was obliged to leave Hulot when his wife found him. Mme.
Hulot promised her a dowry and to wed her to Joseph's oldest son. She
was sometimes called Judix, which is a French corruption of the
Italian name. [Cousin Betty.]

JUDITH. (See Mme. Genestas.)

JULIEN, one of the turnkeys of the Conciergerie in 1830, during the
trial of Herrera--Vautrin--and Rubempre. [Scenes from a Courtesan's
Life.]

JULIEN, probably a native of Champagne; a young man in 1839, and in
the service of Sub-Prefect Goulard, in Arcis-sur-Aube. He learned
through Anicette, and revealed to the Beauvisages and Mollots, the
Legitimist plots of the Chateau de Cinq-Cygne, where lived Georges de
Maufrigneuse, Daniel d'Arthez, Laurence de Cinq-Cygne, Diane de
Cadignan and Berthe de Maufrigneuse. [The Member for Arcis.]

JULLIARD, head of the firm of Julliard in Paris, about 1806. At the
"Ver Chinois," rue Saint-Denis, he sold silk in bolls. Sylvie Rogron
was assistant saleswoman. Twenty years later he met her again in their
native country of Provins, where he had retired in 1815, the head of a
family grouped about the Guepins and the Guenees, thus forming three
great clans. [Pierrette.]

JULLIARD, elder son of the preceding; married the only daughter of a
rich farmer and also conceived a platonic affection at Provins for
Melanie Tiphaine, the most beautiful woman of the official colony
during the Restoration. Julliard followed commerce and literature; he
maintained a stage line, and a journal christened "La Ruche," in which
latter he burned incense to Mme. Tiphaine. [Pierrette.]

JUSSIEU (Julien), youthful conscript in the great draft of 1793. Sent
with a note for lodgment to the home of Mme. de Dey at Carentan, where
he was the innocent cause of that woman's sudden death; she was just
then expecting the return of her son, a Royalist hunted by the
Republican troops. [The Conscript.]

JUSTE, born in 1811, studied medicine in Paris, and afterwards went to
Asia to practice. In 1836 he lived on rue Corneille with Charles
Rabourdin, when they helped the poverty-stricken Zephirin Marcas. [Z.
Marcas.]

JUSTIN, old and experienced valet of the Vidame de Pamiers; was
secretly slain by order of Bourignard because he had discovered the
real name, but carefully concealed, of the father of Mme. Desmarets.
[The Thirteen.]

JUSTINE, was maid to the Comtesse Foedora, in Paris, when her mistress
received calls from M. de Valentin. [The Magic Skin.]



K

KATT, a Flemish woman, the nurse of Lydie de la Peyrade, whom she
attended constantly in Paris on rue des Moineaux about 1829, and
during her mistress' period of insanity on Rue Honore Chevalier in
1840. [Scenes from a Courtesan's Life. The Middle Classes.]

KELLER (Francois), one of the influential and wealthy Parisian
bankers, during a period extending perhaps from 1809 to 1839. As such,
in November, 1809, under the Empire, he was one of the guests at a
fine reception, given by Comte Malin de Gondreville, meeting there
Isemberg, Montcornet, Mesdames de Lansac and de Vandemont, and a mixed
company composed of members of the aristocracy and people illustrious
under the Empire. At this time, moreover, Francois Keller was in the
family of Malin de Gondreville, one of whose daughters he had married.
This marriage, besides making him the brother-in-law of the Marechal
de Carigliano, gave him assurance of the deputyship, which he obtained
in 1816 and held until 1836. The district electors of Arcis-sur-Aube
kept him in the legislature during that long period. Francois Keller
had, by his marriage with Mademoiselle de Gondreville, one son,
Charles, who died before his parents in the spring of 1839. As deputy,
Francois Keller became one of the most noted orators of the Left
Centre. He shone as a member of the opposition, especially from 1819
to 1825. Adroitly he drew about himself the robe of philanthropy.
Politics never turned his attention from finance. Francois Keller,
seconded by his brother and partner, Adolphe Keller, refused to aid
the needy perfumer, Cesar Birotteau. Between 1821 and 1823 the
creditors of Guillaume Grandet, the bankrupt, unanimously selected him
and M. des Grassins of Saumur as adjusters. Despite his display of
Puritanical virtues, the private career of Francois Keller was not
spotless. In 1825 it was known that he had an illegitimate and costly
liaison with Flavie Colleville. Rallying to the support of the new
monarchy from 1830 to 1836, Francois Keller saw his Philippist zeal
rewarded in 1839. He exchanged his commission at the Palais-Bourbon
for a peerage, and received the title of count. [Domestic Peace. Cesar
Birotteau. Eugenie Grandet. The Government Clerks. The Member for
Arcis.]

KELLER (Madame Francois), wife of the preceding; daughter of Malin de
Gondreville; mother of Charles Keller, who died in 1839. Under the
Restoration, she inspired a warm passion in the heart of the son of
the Duchesse de Marigny. [Domestic Peace. The Member for Arcis. The
Thirteen.]

KELLER, (Charles), born in 1809, son of the preceding couple, grandson
of the Comte de Gondreville, nephew of the Marechale de Carigliano;
his life was prematurely ended in 1839, at a time when a brilliant
future seemed before him. As a major of staff at the side of the
Prince Royal, Ferdinand d'Orleans, he took the field in Algeria. His
bravery urged him on in pursuit of the Emir Abd-el-Kader, and he gave
up his life in the face of the enemy. Becoming viscount as a result of
the knighting of his father, and assured of the favors of the heir
presumptive to the throne, Charles Keller, at the moment when death
surprised him, was on the point of taking his seat in the Lower
Chamber; for the body of electors of the district of Arcis-sur-Aube
were almost sure to elect a man whom the Tuileries desired so
ardently. [The Member for Arcis.]

KELLER (Adolphe), brother--probably younger--of Francois and his
partner; a very shrewd man, who was really in charge of the business,
a "regular lynx." On account of his intimate relations with Nucingen
and F. du Tillet, he flatly refused to aid Cesar Birotteau, who
implored his assistance. [The Middle Classes. Pierrette. Cesar
Birotteau.]

KERGAROUET (Comte de), born about the middle of the eighteenth
century; of the Bretagne nobility; entered the navy, served long and
valiantly upon the sea, commanded the "Belle-Poule," and died a vice-
admiral. Possessor of a great fortune, by his charity he made amends
for the foulness of some of his youthful love affairs (1771 and
following), and at Paris, near the Madeleine, towards the beginning of
the nineteenth century, with much delicacy, he helped the Baronne
Leseigneur de Rouville. A little later, at the age of seventy-two,
having for a long time been a widower and retired from the navy, while
enjoying the hospitality of his relatives, the Fontaines and the
Planat de Baudrys, who lived in the neighborhood of Sceaux, Kergarouet
married his niece, one of the daughters of Fontaine. He died before
her. M. de Kergarouet was also a relative of the Portendueres and did
not forget them. [The Purse. The Ball at Sceaux. Ursule Mirouet.]

KERGAROUET (Comtesse de). (See Vandenesse, Marquise Charles de.)

KERGAROUET (Vicomte de), nephew of the Comte de Kergarouet, husband of
a Pen-Hoel, by whom he had four daughters. Evidently lived at Nantes
in 1836. [Beatrix.]

KERGAROUET (Vicomtesse de), wife of the preceding, born at Pen-Hoel
in 1789; younger sister of Jacqueline; mother of four girls, very
affected woman and looked upon as such by Felicite des Touches and
Arthur de Rochefide. Lived in Nantes in 1836. [Beatrix.]

KERGAROUET (Charlotte de), born in 1821, one of the daughters of the
preceding, grand-niece of the Comte de Kergarouet; of his four nieces
she was the favorite of the wealthy Jacqueline de Pen-Hoel; a good-
hearted little country girl; fell in love with Calyste du Guenic in
1836, but did not marry him. [Beatrix.]

KOLB, an Alsatian, served as "man of all work" at the home of the
Didots in Paris; had served in the cuirassiers. Under the Restoration
he became "printer's devil" in the establishment of David Sechard of
Angouleme, for whom he showed an untiring devotion, and whose servant,
Marion, he married. [Lost Illusions.]

KOLB (Marion), wife of the preceding, with whom she became acquainted
while at the home of David Sechard. She was, at first, in the service
of the Angouleme printer, Jerome-Nicholas Sechard, for whom she had
less praise than for David. Marion Kolb was like her husband in her
constant, childlike devotion. [Lost Illusions.]

KOUSKI, Polish lancer in the French Royal Guards, lived very unhappily
in 1815-16, but enjoyed life better the following year. At that time
he lived at Issoudun in the home of the wealthy Jean-Jacques Rouget,
and served the commandant, Maxence Gilet. The latter became the idol
of the grateful Kouski. [A Bachelor's Establishment.]

KROPOLI (Zena), Montenegrin of Zahara, seduced in 1809 by the French
gunner, Auguste Niseron, by whom she had a daughter, Genevieve. One
year later, at Vincennes, France, she died as a result of her
confinement. The necessary marriage papers, which would have rendered
valid the situation of Zena Kropoli, arrived a few days after her
death. [The Peasantry.]
